       "   'review_text': \"Hotel is contemporary and furnished beautifully. Location is amazing, theres some really stunning beaches near by and amenities. Local restaurants especially by the marina serve authentic Spanish food with gorgeous view's. Upon hotel arrival we recieved a warm welcome with drinks, which was lovely. I'd recommend car rental as its a beautiful island to explore and hotel parking is easy and accessible. Decent sized pools, life guards however, are abrupt towards children which is unacceptable. Bar staff didn't appear to know how to make hot chocolate for a child and were very rude stating 'its not my problem' (strange behaviour). Cocktails are very poor but that's across the island, best to stick to beer or wine! Entertainment isn't great but they have some good activities for children. Breakfast and lunch is decent/boring. Dinner wasn't very pleasant,  unfortunately zero flavour, repetitive, limited choice and soup was always cold (disappointing). Staff appear very tired, rude and drained which makes you feel uncomfortable. On most days i couldn't find any staff members it was almost as though the hotel had been abandoned. There is no guidance on how to use or access anything. Larder bar has to be the worst bar (near main pool) and is quite dirty. Rooms are nice however, bathroom doors do not lock therefore zero privacy and unfortunately we had flies and  cockroaches which was really off putting. Pull out bed is painful to sleep on but main bed was amazing! Nobody picks up when you call reception and for some reason nearly every staff member struggles to speak English when it suits them. Nobody bothered cleaning our room on our last day which was a shame.\\nSpa was very good, massages are brilliant which i highly recommend if you can withstand the negatives. This hotel is NOT 5* but certainly 3* at the most. I would not stay here again or recommend it unfortunately. But I value the experience and shall remember how beautiful the Island is.\",\n",

       "   'review_text': \"One of my favorite holidays! This hotel is located in Mogan, the harbour, with restaurants and shops, is only a 15 minute walk away from the hotel and the nearest supermarket and small shopping centre which contains shops and a few restaurants is only a 5 minute walk away from the hotel reception exit. The hotel itself is well run, luxurious and has a great layout. The 2 pools and a very shallow pool, allow adults to have some quiet time on the 1st floor pool, while children can play with balls, be loud and mess around in the kids pool on floor 0 (which is slightly salty) but you don't notice it. Floor 0 also is where the entertainment takes place and also where the restaurants, bar, gym and spa are located. On floor 0 there is a smaller restaurant for lunch which is next to the quiet pool, there is also a volleyball court, tennis court, paddle court and a football court which is open 24/7 to have a kick about with your friends or to play a organized game by the hotel at 10am on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays! Floors 2 and 3 only have rooms, but floor 4 has a sun deck and yoga deck. The food at the breakfast buffet is nice and runs until 11am. The hotel staff are very nice and helpful and the room service is quick and anything you need at the hotel, they will most likely have it, such as a power adapter for UK plugs, clothes drier, extra pillows etc. Overall I had a great experience at the hotel and definitely would stay at a raddison blu hotel again!\",\n",

       "   'review_text': \"Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the hotel is great. I hope my comments help you make a choice because there's a few things to consider. We went 9th-19th September. This is by far the busiest hotel I have ever stayed in, this is not a criticism at all, just shows how popular it is. There's a constant buzz of people everywhere - but it is not loud and we still found the atmosphere and poolside very relaxing. We don't have kids but even as an outsider, we could tell it's very family friendly. Being child-free shouldn't put you off though, it's caters very well for most. I'd say if you want seclusion or you don't want to be around kids at all, this is not the place for you and perhaps look for something adults only. Also, if you want to be partying all night in an 18-30's type vibe, also not for you. Despite the busy atmosphere of people and kids activities, most people are sat peacefully, with a glass of sangria relaxing!\\n\\nThe staff are great! Lots of languages spoken, we mainly heard German, English and Spanish. I tried with my terrible Spanish though and they do appreciate you having a go! Everyone was very knowledgeable and helpful. On the last day, I think because it seemed quieter, we got offered drinks poolside and table service - which was ace! I wish we'd had this service all the time.\\n\\nThe rooms are air conditioned and the air conditioning is quiet too for the most part, unless it hasn't been on and it means you want to dramatically change the temperature. We had two room keys and generally left one in the power so the air con was on whilst we were out and about so we always came back to the room nice and cool. The room was serviced daily. My only critique here is that the consumables weren't consistently replaced, teabags, milks, toiletries. However, bed made, bins emptied, floors mopped, towels changed etc, all very consistent. Beds were by far the most comfy I've ever slept in at a hotel - kudos! Note, ours was two single beds pushed together, rather than a double/king bed. Not a problem at all.\\n\\nThe gym.... I used the gym 6/10 days. Good things are it's generally empty. I'd describe it as small for the size of the hotel but that comment is irrelevant really as the most people in there when I used it was 3, including me. It would perhaps be a waste of space to make it any larger. I only used the cardio machines and it's functional but in need of an update really. The treadmills, no problems but little things like you can see rust forming, one of them the touch screen hardly worked. The exercise bike is so old and rusty you can't adjust the seat. The rowing machine, I couldn't keep my feet in (could have been me though)! There didn't feel much resistance because it was some sort of water thing (hard to explain!). Just generally, it needs an update in my opinion but you'll get by if you want to use it.\\n\\nDidn't visit the spa, prices are what you'd expect for a hotel which priced us out.\\n\\nFinally, breakfast. Oh my goodness me, best breakfast buffet ever. It's chaotic, lots of people, trying to get what they need but I was very impressed. We usually ate around 9:00-10:00 ish. All what you'd expect, hot 'English' breakfast, cheese, meats, bread, cereal, pastries, juices, yogurts but there's a few things that went above and beyond for me. Cava is freely available if you fancy a cheeky breakfast mimosa, smoked salmon freely available too. (I find that most places charge extra for salmon and fizz). Tea and coffee brought to the table and hot milk provided as standard. Egg station - so you can get an omelette made with your choice of filling fresh in front of you and fried eggs are done to order. I personally really liked this, I hate picking up a fried egg that looks like it's sad and been under a hot plate for hours. I felt like all these little extras, with the plethora of choice in the first place made it fantastic. There's so much fruit, bread, cheese, meat, the choice really is superb.\",\n",

However, on this occasion, this was sadly not the case.\\nThe first room we were offered, although nice and clean,  smelt like cigarette smoke and there was very little privacy and so we were kindly moved to a second room. This room had an ant infestation and when I informed reception of this they sent maintenance who sprayed the room with ant killer. We were then informed the problem had been dealt with. Unfortunately, the problem had not been dealt with and there were still a significant number of ants crawling over the surfaces and around the bed. I, therefore, therefore asked to move again. I was told by the manager that there were no rooms available and that the hotel was fully booked. I quickly checked online and showed him that I was able to book several rooms for my stay and he then changed his tune and offered me a ground-floor room but couldn't guarantee there were no ants. I informed him that for a 5-star hotel this was not good enough but I would take the room. When waiting for the room to be made up he managed to 'find' a higher-up room which we moved to. Fortunately, there were no ants but there was a very strong sewerage smell coming from the drains.\\nExcept for the evening manager, the staff were all very helpful and the facilities were clean.\\nI feel the hotel requires some maintenance as cracks are showing in the plaster, damp patches are visible on the ceilings and mould was present in all of the bathrooms we were in.\\nFor a five-star hotel I expected better and always have experienced better so this time it was an exceptionally disappointing visit.\",\n",

If you accept that, I would imagine you won't be as disappointed.\\nIt's a massive hotel but with no soul and certainly doesn't look or feel Spanish in any way. Just feels like any other large corporate hotel.\\nPlus points, all the staff were friendly, professional and courteous.\\nBreakfast was fairly standard fare, some items could be a bit hit and miss but a good selection.\\nWe ate dinner only on the one night and it was very disappointing. Stone cold steak with stone cold mushroom sauce (not even sure how's it possible that these could be cold!) that was left uneaten.\\nThe sofa bed in the bedroom was so uncomfortable that we had to request a mattress topper for it, they supplied a piece of foam. I wouldn't stay again for that reason alone.\\nThe quiet pool area is in poor condition with tiles lifting from the bottom of the pool. Never seen this in a 5-star hotel.\\nRoom condition was no where near what I would expect for a 5-star hotel, cleaning again a 3/5.

There are two pools+the childrens pool, both are very nice, one is salwater, and the other one is water with chlorine. Near the kids pool besides the \"VIC kid\\'s club\", there is an arcade machine, a mini-billiard table, an airhockey game, and a candy claw machine. The breakfast buffet is nice aswell, there is a big selection of food aswell as drinks. As for the restaurants on the hotel, you will find 4. The 2 pool bars, the buffet and restaurant \"Fillini\". Both pool bars\\' kitchen open at around 13 and close at 16/17 if im correct. The buffet is called \"Around The World Buffet\" and serves differently geographically themed food every night, which is very nice. The restaurant \"Fillini\" serves italian food for both lunch and dinner. The hotel is located nicely within the mountains, and is near a nice promenade that leads to the city/beach. They have a free parking service in the basement level, which is very nice if you are renting a car. I can really reccomend this, especially if you are staying with younger children.',\n",

       "   'review_text': 'Hotel is great. A family room is two separate rooms (and bathrooms) with a shared lobby and access via the balconies which is perfect when you have teens / tweens.\\nWe had half board and enjoyed both breakfast and dinner for 5 days. Good selection and the staff are all very friendly and accommodating. I didn‚Äôt like the house wine by the glass so we bought a more expensive bottle and were able to put it away each night and enjoy it the following night.\\nCommon areas are very spacious and separating the adult and child pools works well. There are activities and entertainment if you want them but you are not forced into it. Location is excellent and far less touristy than other places on the island.\\nOnly gripe would be you only get free water in the room on the first day, this isn‚Äôt replaced.',\n",

It is fantastic to read that our comfortable family room, the half board meal choice, friendly staff, spacious common areas and the hotel¬¥s  location close to the Mogan port were to your liking. We hope to have another chance to welcome you again. Kind regards',\n",

The entertainment provided was very mixed. The karaoki was dire, the dance team and the acrobats were very limited, and a singing duo just sang along to a tape. One couple shone. They sang rock songs from the 80s and 90s. I forget their name but they were on on the Wednesday evenings. Our balcony was unuseable most of the day as the music from the children's area below was so loud we couldn't sit there. Perhaps rooms in that are should be allocated to families rather that an older couple like ourselves.

Lovely jacuzzi beside large swimming pool. Water temperature lukewarm so pleasant for swimming and we cud hear the music playing at childrens pool. There is also a quiet pool area on level 1 but we like to see the children enjoying themselves. Food was excellent and we also got 1 free night with 3 course meal at the Italian on site  restaurant during our stay, which we really enjoyed. We booked a superior room with pool view and was worth the additional cost. The only negative is the port is about 15 mins downhill but def worth seeing. Large supermarket 5 mins walk away.

Room's not clean like they should be, lot's of dust on wall lights, human hair in bathroom from previous visitors. During breakfast waitress not bother to offer you coffee and they not even bother to remove all used plates from the table, so you might end up having lot's of empty plate before anyone going to notice. During dinner please check your bill if ordering any drinks because they tend to overcharge by putting on bill drink bigger than you drank so for example we had 25cl beer but on the receipt was 45cl beer. So very unprofessional!!! Selection of food for breakfast is very limited and luck of choices...the same every morning. Dinner is not bad but definitely not perfect for 5 star hotel!!! I personally not recommend this hotel for few reasons, overpriced, poor cleanliness, unprofessional waitress with very limited English, food choice average!!!\",\n",

       "   'review_text': 'We stayed in Mogan Raddison blu in April 22 as a couple. Personally I would not call it a five star hotel I would call it a good four-star hotel. We had a lovely room overlooking the pool with an extended patio area\\nthe beds were super comfortable I liked the soft squishy pillows but the husband wanted a firmer pillow and that was no problem because it was changed as soon as we asked..  cleaning by the maids was good I wouldn‚Äôt say perfect because often our bathroom wasn‚Äôt swept properly. The breakfast is buffet style with chefs cooking eggs omelettes et cetera and I would say it was a fantastic choice all of the waiting staff were super helpful and efficient.\\nThere is an enormous pool for children and families which seemed very well used whilst we were there there was still quite a few children who were on Easter holidays. On the upper deck there is a quiet zone Pool\\nI cannot understand why it‚Äôs just not for adults ? to me it seems completely pointless having a quiet area when the children can still come up and down and start using the pool..  admittedly the lifeguard in attendance was very quick to tell people when they were making too much noise , but  families with kids have got a choice of two swimming pools whereas if you‚Äôre an adult on your own the likelihood of you sitting downstairs with the kids pool is unlikely.\\n\\nWe didn‚Äôt use the restaurants in the evening so can‚Äôt comment , we chose to walk into town each evening.\\nI would recommend this hotel but I think primarily it‚Äôs a family hotel .\\n\\nThe staff were all lovely üòä and we enjoyed our stay .',\n",

At check in we were told one of our two rooms bookings didn't exist (despite me showing them both confirmation numbers) and was bluntly told that they had no rooms and we couldn't stay there that night. They outright denied the problem was anything to do with Radisson, multiple times. We were told we couldn't stay.\\nThe booking was via British Airways who then had a long argument with the reception staff on our behalf, and it transpired that Radisson had received but failed to note the second room booking.\\nThe hotel begrudgingly gave a second room (suddenly one was available) and we were told we would need to move rooms during the week. When we turned up at reception the next morning, as requested, to find out what moves would be needed - they had no idea who we were or what the issue was. Super frustrating!\\nI've had plenty of experiences of bookings being incorrectly processed, but I've never been treated with such utter contempt as my family was here. No apology was given either.

       "   'review_text': 'We stayed here as a family of 4 (2 teenagers) in April 22 and loved it! The hotel was spotless, the staff excellent and great facilities for all ages. Loved the architecture with the hexagons, wide open spaces and light! In a quiet location, surrounded by mountains and a short pleasant walk to the beach and marina. Peurto Mogan is just beautiful - the nicest resort we have stayed at in all the Canaries! Sympathetically developed from the 1980s, still has a large local population and we found it attracted locals from elsewhere in the canaries at Easter, a good sign that it‚Äôs not just full of Brits and has local bars/eateries. We only ate at the Radisson buffet in the evenings 3 times - used half board for our lunch and went to the beachfront and marina at night. Food was great though, and very clean and efficient buffet. Would definitely return and recommend.',\n",

The food was great, drinks and cocktails were well prepared, great COVID safety awareness, nice and comfortable furniture on the pool area, bar and recreational area. The staff were very kind, and the location of the hotel is perfect. They also have a quiet pool for people without children that wish a more relaxed environment. To name other things that weren\\'t that great, they were a little understaffed and the app to communicate with the reception was not effective. Better to use the good old phone to speak with reception. Needs some small maintenance on the rooms on small things like lamps that were rusty, mirror frame paint was falling apart and some small other things. For me one of the worst things were the cushions overlay on the room hammocks that were in need of replacement or a good cleaning but the rest was very pleasant and enjoyable. Had a very good time.

       "   'review_text': \"We stayed here from the 17th - 31st July. This is a lovely place to stay is the first things I would say. The buildings are quite new and it is enclosed and secure. The Covid-19 enforcement is really good too. They strongly encourage you to wear a mask all the time except when you are eating, drinking or on a sun lounger. The Pools are immaculate and even the family pool isn't too noisy. We took full board tickets for 7 nights and the rest of the time we went out into town which is just 10 minutes walk. The breakfasts are very good and the dinners are fine. If you have visited Turkish hotel buffets for similar hotels then you will not have the same standard but frankly you won't be disappointed. The staff are very professional and friendly. I have two minor criticisms, the first is that the drinks and lunch menu in the pool bar are over priced. The same is true for drinks in the evening with dinner. Do go for a walk in the surrounding hills and enjoy the Port in the evening. would we come and stay there again? Yes, of course we would.\",\n",

       "   'review_text': \"We stayed here for 9 nights from the 29th October 2021 and opted for breakfast only.\\n\\nWe arrived before check-in (which is at 3pm) but the reception staff managed to get our room ready for 2pm which was very helpful. There is a secure luggage room that we left our bags in whilst we went to sit at the pool bar.\\n\\nThe room was very clean and spacious. The bed was super soft which I like, but might not be to everyone's taste. Mini fridge and safe included in the room.\\n\\nPlenty of food to choose from at breakfast. I particularly enjoyed the egg station and the Pastry station. Fresh omelette every morning - yummy!\\n\\nWe spent our days at the 'quiet pool' which is at the other end of the hotel to the kids pool which was perfect for us. The sunbeds are quiet close together but there was room to move them slightly further away from other people if needed. It great that you can't reserve sunbeds before 10am so there isn't that mad early morning rush. The lifeguard does remove items left on sunbeds before 10am.\\n\\nWe visited the gym several times during our stay. Due to covid, only 4 people can be in the gym at any one time so you have to go to reception to book your hour slot. The popular times, ie early morning and before dinner get busy, so you do have to plan your trips. You can't just turn up like you would pre-covid.\\n\\nWe didn't use the salt water pool, the kids pool or see any of the evening entertainment shows so can't comment on those.\\n\\nOverall we enjoyed our stay l but I've removed 1 star as we encountered some little annoyances. For example, toiletries in our room weren't placed - we had to find a cleaner one morning as we were running very low on toilet paper. There's no drinking water taps around the hotel so we popped to the local supermarket to buy bottled water. We could buy water at the bar, but its far cheaper to buy at the supermarket (2-3 min walk). We also bought some alcohol at the shop to enjoy in the room pre dinner but annoyingly the cleaner didn't replace the dirty wine glasses the next morning.\\n\\nI appreciate my negatives aren't that major, but I do think its important to mention here.\",\n",

       "   'review_text': 'What a great hotel this is. Stayed here in July  on a B&B basis. The room was fantastic. I missed having a kitchen but the breakfast buffet spread had all you could want regardless of your nationality. The staff were fantastic from the front of house down to cleaners all always had a smile and greeting for you. The grounds are well kept and clean as are all the areas. Never seen a pool without towels on sunbeds before, even at 10:00. It has  2 pool areas of which 1 is classed as a quiet area the other for children with its own fun pool. The last time we were in Puerto Mogan 3 years ago the hotel was being built. I was a little apprehensive about coming back in case the hotel had a adverse effect on the area, this proved to be unfounded as the local area seems to have been enhanced by the arrival on this great hotel. Well done to all concerned.',\n",

Eating and drinking in the hotel is  a bit expensive but there is a store near by and you get fresh bottled water in your room. There are plenty of alternative places to eat, all within a 15 minute walk.\\nThere is a good range of activities available in the hotel.

Staff made no effort to 'control' or even advise them.\\nLife gaurd is NOT present all day. Every 5 mins he dissappears off, with no replacement in place.\\nMy only other observations would be on our room. We were expecting a double bed and got 2 singles pushed together, this doesn't work, is quiet disappointing and actually a bit of an atmosphere killer! The other observation is only 1x bin in a huge room (niggly I know).\\nStaff are very helpful and pleasent.\\nWe are B&B board and the breakfast turn out is superb; everything you could imagine x10.\\nAs expected bar prices are much higher than the surrounding bars and restraunts.\\nHalf a lager and lime and a double Grey Goose and coke was over 20euros.\",\n",

       "   'review_text': \"Frankly, I expected more from a 5-star hotel. Ok, the pools, the staff, the rooms and facilities are excellent overall. What didn't I like? 1. Extremely soft mattress gave me a sore back and low quality sleep. 2. Showers were fab but a door or curtain was lacking. 3. Breakfast was a shambles, terribly organised. The cereals and flakes even came in plastic packets! What on earth for, apart from generating more food and plastic waste? 4. The design was too harsh for me, all the angles and straight lines make it rather cold, and make it stand out from the environment.\\n\\nI could go on, but I won't. Would I go back? Maybe, but it certainly won't be my first choice.\",\n",

Only semi-decent act was the magician which proved to be popular but then staff could not handle the drinks demand and orders fell into chaos. There was not a huge amount of people but staff could not handle. They ended up serving my kids alcoholic drinks which we luckily caught.\\n- The system of ordering drinks and delivery does not work. You often see people wandering about with your order not knowing who to take it to. This only applies to the bars however. In the restaurant it works well.\\n- Eating outside is great but there are too many flies. They need to address this.\\n- Rooms are generally clean with the exception of the floors. Floors are only swept daily and not very well. Not sure if its a time limitation or what but more effort needs to be made. A vacuum would make a big difference. Corridor floors also need to be addressed. I know people will pull in a lot of dirt and it's difficult to manage but in block 3 the gardeners have their storage room and it could be 2-3 days before the mess they made was cleaned up. Saying that all of the main public areas are kept very clean so there is no excuse.\\n- Watch out for the grumpy lifeguard. Safety is priority but this guy is a real grump. All other lifeguards are good.\\n\\nThe hotel wants to be 5 star but somehow doesn't quite make it, they have some improvements to make.\",\n",

We stayed here soon after it opened and there were some teething problems, like having your room cleaned at 6pm one day and then 8am the next (we had gone out for a run and were surprised the room got cleaned again so soon, we hadn't even used our towels). Also the gym was quite small and often had no towels or water available (people tended to fill up bottles at the gym, regardless if they were using it or not).\\nBreakfast was included and had everything you could want and was generally very nice. The Italian resturant at the hotel was also quite good (again we were there opening week before Christmas, so were the only people there, which was nice).\\nOverall a nice place, it is getting busier and with that comes the annoyance of other guests being around.\",\n",

The premises do not highlight that you are in a selective place. Everything outside looks sterile. On the \"upper deck\", artificial grass could certainly not be avoided due to the climate, but no real privacy there, where you hear everything from the \"activity pool\" on the ground floor. The architects\\' sole accolade is for letting the natural breeze coming from the sea upwards the valley to the hotel. It is certainly a good place for business reasons -- just wondering why in this case choose the relatively secluded Puerto Mog√†n compared to other places on Gran Canaria -- but not for holiday reasons or a simple pool holiday.',\n",

       "   'review_text': 'Just returned from a superb stay; the hotel and holiday was perfect from start to finish. It began with a friendly and very informative check-in over a glass of cava. The room was great (1328) - specious and clean with a massive balcony, which had the sun on it until at least 3pm. Although it overlooked the children‚Äôs pool (we were holidaying with a well-behaved 7-year old) it wasn‚Äôt at all noisy and didn‚Äôt distract from an extremely relaxing and pleasant stay. Both breakfast and dinner were fantastic - a plethora of tasty treats to choose from, which varied enough from day to day. Although the hotel was full, it never felt too busy at any time in the dining area. The Italian restaurant Filini was equally delicious and worth sampling. We enjoyed our stay so much that we have already booked to return, something I have never done before. Puerto Mogan was a short (easy) walk away and definitely worth exploring - such a beautiful place. Across the road was an excellent Super Dino shop that sold everything needed. The staff were exceptional and made our stay even better. If you are thinking of booking this hotel, do so; you don‚Äôt regret it.',\n",

We loved the 50\" Samsung Smart TV with YouTube, really helped at times with the kids. Hotel WiFi throughout rooms and common areas was strong and stable. Beds were very comfortable, my only small gripe would be the super soft pillows but pillows are subjective anyway. Bathroom large with wet room shower. We had a fantastic large balcony overlooking the pool, great for watching the sun go down worth a drink in your hand. There was a gym, running track, tennis courts and a climbing wall. Entertainment every night. Poolside bar offering food and drinks served to your sunbed if you wish. The main restaurant offers high quality food. We were half-board, the breakfasts were vast and offered every conceivable breakfast you could want, dinner is a buffet with a different underlying theme each night. There was so much choice, starters, salads, mains, deserts; hardest bit was not trying it all. Hotel is located in a small beach village area, far away from some of the busier more commercial resorts on the island. This was a bonus for us, the hotel and area was full of couples and young families, no rowdy groups at all. Lots of Spanish holiday here too, which is a good sign. The beach is an easy 15 min walk from the hotel to a small bay sandy beach with great shallow sea, brilliant for kids. Lovely vibe down there, lots of bars and restaurants and very pretty marina. The hotel staff are all extremely friendly and helpful, nothing was too much bother. Wasn\\'t the cheapest holiday we\\'ve had but it definitely was one of the nicest places we\\'ve ever stayed at, so money well spent I think. We wouldn\\'t hesitate to highly recommend the Radisson Blu, thanks for an awesome holiday!',\n",

       "   'review_text': \"Really lovely hotel, very different compared to the Coridal ( the other 5star hotel across the road) it's super modern and extremely clean, the two different pools are great, the top floor pool is a quiet pool and the lower floor is for children and has aquatic fitness activities too, the main win for this hotel is the rooms, they are gorgeous! Huge balconies too with sun loungers which is great. Also my mum is coeliac and the range of gluten free options in the breakfast was amazing, it had a separate toaster and microwave. Will definitely be returning next January!\",\n",

Lovely to hear that our food offer adapted to your Mum's specific dietary requirements. We all look forward to your January stay next year. Sunny regards from Mogan.\",\n",

       "   'review_text': 'Overall I enjoyed my stay at the Radisson Blu Resort & Spa, Gran Canaria Mogan.\\nLarge resort, beautiful, relaxing, spacious\\n\\nThe worse thing...Breakfast is a daily disaster. Think the different happy faces on the breakfast information card given at check-in with the different smiley faces (happy to sad) are representative of the faces of the staff at breakfast time. At peak time, they are stressed. The service was so uncoordinated overall.\\n\\nThe sliced fruit was disappointing. No variety and usually empty or the slices of the fruit were gigantic. Who needs a half plate size slice of watermelon?\\n\\nThere were BBQ tongs (very long) for guest to use for the buffet food. Difficult for children to use and often they dropped them on the floor (and put them back). These types of tongs are not at all appropriate for a buffet.\\n\\nThere were next to no labels on food for breakfast where it mattered. There were some items that were out that even the staff didn‚Äôt know what it was. Labels were on for dinner though.\\n\\nSliced meat and cheese were kept at room temperature, start of breakfast to the end.\\n\\nThe orange juice constantly ran out and the bottles brought out were not cleaned to the touch. Very sticky. Overall the drinks are in the wrong area of the buffet. They should be in the back where the gluten section is in my opinion‚Ä¶.out of the way...especially if they have to be refilled frequently. I nearly saw about 12 bottles nearly crash to the floor.\\n\\nALL of the eggs, any way you had them were pretty much overcooked.\\n\\nPancakes and Waffles, cold and burnt. The pastries/doughnuts were lovely...tasty but self served from a distance with those super long BBQ tongs again.\\n\\nDinner was pretty decent but at 30Euros...was way too expensive...grossly overpriced for mostly side dishes on the buffet.\\n\\nThe grounds were very clean but the housekeeping was not the best. Beds were changed every other day...which was good. Floors weren‚Äôt cleaned properly though. The floors outside each room looked worn as well as they haven‚Äôt been cared for.\\n\\nOur beach towels were taken and not replaced on the 2nd day.\\n\\nAlso my particular housekeeper kindly helped herself to my chewing gum everyday since buying it. It became a joke with my partner. 3 sticks missing one day, 2 sticks missing another...out of a 15 pack of gum, I only had 2 sticks...she or someone else had half of the pack.. Needless to say, although not entirely a big issue I did feel a bit uneasy about leaving things about.\\n\\nThe pools were great‚Ä¶.quiet and non quiet pools. The evening adult entertainment was average. They appear to not always kept to the schedule of the children‚Äôs events though despite them being posted.\\n\\nAgain, overall, the hotel, location and amenities were great. Having stayed at other hotels, the standard of service were weren‚Äôt the best for a 5 star hotel...at least in the housekeeping and kitchen. The food was disappointing but there are plenty of nice cheap restaurants nearby.\\n\\nWould I visit again, perhaps...yes. Recommend‚Ä¶ depends on what you are after in a holiday.',\n",

All the usual breakfast items but also whole salmon ( 2 types), pate, meatballs, and a whole Scandi section.  They had fresh OJ in pitchers, but if that wasn't fresh enough for your taste they had a juice press.\\nALL the staff were exceptional!

Fish was delicious!!!\\nThe team doing the pool/outdoor areas activities were great. From aqua gym which was fun to water polo in the pool. And football, archery, volleyball and rock climbing all on site.\\nThere is a quiet area with massive sunbathing and pool area. A gym. A full size tennis court. Pool tables and table tennis table which the kids loved!!\\nThere was evening entertainment which to be honest we didn't really see as we were too tired, but it was not loud and couldn't here it in our room.\\nWe were half board but you are able to switch your evening meal to lunch, which then enabled us to walk down to the port (10 mins) and have food there. The restaurants in the actual port area are very good, again the fish is very good!!\\nThere is also a supermarket about 5 minutes walk away which we used to get water and snacks (was cheaper) and there are some clothes/perfume/souvenir shops.\\nWe'd hired a car and travelled off the beaten track right up into the hills which are beautiful. Lots of little taverns and friendly people.\\n\\nThere is still a lot to say and do but I would recommend this place to anyone. This is the only review I've ever done of a hotel so I must be impressed!!!\\nOh, and the waterpark is not far away, if you go buy some water shoes there cheaper than at the market), and its worth investing in the 'fast pass' arm band, as some of the rides had quite a queue and we literally walked straight to the front meaning we got lots more turns on all the rides instead of being stood in a queue. And take a picnic, because we only bought 2 diet cokes and that was 10 Euros!!!!! God knows how much the food was!!!\\n\\nGreat hotel, great holiday, great people!!! Nothing else to say!!!!\",\n",

       "   'review_text': \"I've been to 5 star hotels and surely its not one of them.The staff is nice but their knowledge of english can not be accepted in a 5star hotel!! Inflatables are not allowed in the pool so avoid with kids.Its okay to pay an extra for the spa, but it should be a daily fee not for 3 hours.Service is average but very slow, bar and room both. I still dont regret that I've come here but it became an experience to avoid and warn people to not to pick this place.\",\n",

       "   'review_text': 'lovely hotel , spacious , airy relaxing. Lovely to have a separate quiet area around one of the pools. The rooms are very nice and quiet. I do think the hotel will need to work a bit harder to keep their 5 star rating though. We have over the years stayed in a lot of five star hotels and there are a few things which could cause trouble. when we arrived it was very calm and lovely but it soon became extremely busy and i feel the staff is not really coping. Breakfast buffe very nice but very crowded and long queues for for example pancakes. No breadrolls for breakfast which meant half cut bits of bread lying around. Sticky serving spoons which frankly is unhygienic.\\nBoth my husband and I had a massage in the spa which was nice but therapist did not know a word of english? It was the same with some of the restaurant staff and cleaning staff. If you pay a lot to stay in a five star hotel you would expect the staff to know basic english.Some reviews regarding the cleanliness are true, the rooms never really smelt freshly cleaned.  The hotel still deserves a five star rating since all of the above comments are easy to deal with.\\nSusanne and family',\n",
