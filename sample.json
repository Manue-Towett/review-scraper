My wife, son and I had a great time.\n\nThe rooms are a very impressive size, the pool areas are fantastic and there is plenty of space and lots to do throughout the day.  A special mention to the staff that do the entertainment and games by the pool. They work so hard all day and really help everyone Kids and adults to have a good time. All the staff at the hotel were friendly, always smiling and really made our stay enjoyable. The hotel was always extremely clean. The evening entertainment was a good standard which in my experience is a plus as often it can be shocking.\n\nThe location of the hotel is fantastic. Only a 10-minute walk into the port which is stunning and lots of places to eat and drink.\n\nNow for my one and only criticism but it didn't have any negative impact on our stay. The pull out sofa bed in the bedroom is so uncomfortable. It is like lying on a bed of lumpy metal. All it needs is some kind of mattress topper like they have on the main beds and that will be problem solved.\n\nThank you to everyone at the hotel.",

Removed towels off the sun beds while I took my daughter to the toilet as weren\u2019t allowed to reserve sunbeds (we\u2019d been gone 2 minutes.)

And 2 sunlounger very  comfortable too. For me, the walk to the harbour  was hard .but found a taxi rank for less than 5 euros, and we asked  hotel reception to ring a taxi .took less than  5 mins to come . But for people who are OK to walk  good location to walk down to the harbour  for the restaurants,  shops would take  15 minutes or less. Would highly recommend this hotel.. There is a spar on sight. I have a massage booked  for later today . There is a gym on site and football, tennis,volleyball  pichers.and a rock-climbing wall plenty to do for the children and adults to do",

Local restaurants especially by the marina serve authentic Spanish food with gorgeous view's. Upon hotel arrival we recieved a warm welcome with drinks, which was lovely. I'd recommend car rental as its a beautiful island to explore and hotel parking is easy and accessible. Decent sized pools, life guards however, are abrupt towards children which is unacceptable. Bar staff didn't appear to know how to make hot chocolate for a child and were very rude stating 'its not my problem' (strange behaviour). Cocktails are very poor but that's across the island, best to stick to beer or wine! Entertainment isn't great but they have some good activities for children. Breakfast and lunch is decent/boring. Dinner wasn't very pleasant,  unfortunately zero flavour, repetitive, limited choice and soup was always cold (disappointing). Staff appear very tired, rude and drained which makes you feel uncomfortable. On most days i couldn't find any staff members it was almost as though the hotel had been abandoned. There is no guidance on how to use or access anything. Larder bar has to be the worst bar (near main pool) and is quite dirty. Rooms are nice however, bathroom doors do not lock therefore zero privacy and unfortunately we had flies and  cockroaches which was really off putting. Pull out bed is painful to sleep on but main bed was amazing! Nobody picks up when you call reception and for some reason nearly every staff member struggles to speak English when it suits them. Nobody bothered cleaning our room on our last day which was a shame.\nSpa was very good, massages are brilliant which i highly recommend if you can withstand the negatives. This hotel is NOT 5* but certainly 3* at the most. I would not stay here again or recommend it unfortunately. But I value the experience and shall remember how beautiful the Island is.",

Breakfast isn\u2019t as good as it used to be, but still good. We are a family of four with young children, our room is next to the quiet pool. Been told to go to kids pool by life guard a few times my children are young but not really loud, just excited, what annoys me about this is there are kids in the pool at 10:30 pm making so much noice my children get woken up.\nIt\u2019s not that this hotel is bad,anything but, but it\u2019s not quite as good as it was, and because of that we probably wouldn\u2019t return",

                "review_text": "One of my favorite holidays! This hotel is located in Mogan, the harbour, with restaurants and shops, is only a 15 minute walk away from the hotel and the nearest supermarket and small shopping centre which contains shops and a few restaurants is only a 5 minute walk away from the hotel reception exit. The hotel itself is well run, luxurious and has a great layout. The 2 pools and a very shallow pool, allow adults to have some quiet time on the 1st floor pool, while children can play with balls, be loud and mess around in the kids pool on floor 0 (which is slightly salty) but you don't notice it. Floor 0 also is where the entertainment takes place and also where the restaurants, bar, gym and spa are located. On floor 0 there is a smaller restaurant for lunch which is next to the quiet pool, there is also a volleyball court, tennis court, paddle court and a football court which is open 24/7 to have a kick about with your friends or to play a organized game by the hotel at 10am on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays! Floors 2 and 3 only have rooms, but floor 4 has a sun deck and yoga deck. The food at the breakfast buffet is nice and runs until 11am. The hotel staff are very nice and helpful and the room service is quick and anything you need at the hotel, they will most likely have it, such as a power adapter for UK plugs, clothes drier, extra pillows etc. Overall I had a great experience at the hotel and definitely would stay at a raddison blu hotel again!",

                "review_text": "Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the hotel is great. I hope my comments help you make a choice because there's a few things to consider. We went 9th-19th September. This is by far the busiest hotel I have ever stayed in, this is not a criticism at all, just shows how popular it is. There's a constant buzz of people everywhere - but it is not loud and we still found the atmosphere and poolside very relaxing. We don't have kids but even as an outsider, we could tell it's very family friendly. Being child-free shouldn't put you off though, it's caters very well for most. I'd say if you want seclusion or you don't want to be around kids at all, this is not the place for you and perhaps look for something adults only. Also, if you want to be partying all night in an 18-30's type vibe, also not for you. Despite the busy atmosphere of people and kids activities, most people are sat peacefully, with a glass of sangria relaxing!\n\nThe staff are great! Lots of languages spoken, we mainly heard German, English and Spanish. I tried with my terrible Spanish though and they do appreciate you having a go! Everyone was very knowledgeable and helpful. On the last day, I think because it seemed quieter, we got offered drinks poolside and table service - which was ace! I wish we'd had this service all the time.\n\nThe rooms are air conditioned and the air conditioning is quiet too for the most part, unless it hasn't been on and it means you want to dramatically change the temperature. We had two room keys and generally left one in the power so the air con was on whilst we were out and about so we always came back to the room nice and cool. The room was serviced daily. My only critique here is that the consumables weren't consistently replaced, teabags, milks, toiletries. However, bed made, bins emptied, floors mopped, towels changed etc, all very consistent. Beds were by far the most comfy I've ever slept in at a hotel - kudos! Note, ours was two single beds pushed together, rather than a double/king bed. Not a problem at all.\n\nThe gym.... I used the gym 6/10 days. Good things are it's generally empty. I'd describe it as small for the size of the hotel but that comment is irrelevant really as the most people in there when I used it was 3, including me. It would perhaps be a waste of space to make it any larger. I only used the cardio machines and it's functional but in need of an update really. The treadmills, no problems but little things like you can see rust forming, one of them the touch screen hardly worked. The exercise bike is so old and rusty you can't adjust the seat. The rowing machine, I couldn't keep my feet in (could have been me though)! There didn't feel much resistance because it was some sort of water thing (hard to explain!). Just generally, it needs an update in my opinion but you'll get by if you want to use it.\n\nDidn't visit the spa, prices are what you'd expect for a hotel which priced us out.\n\nFinally, breakfast. Oh my goodness me, best breakfast buffet ever. It's chaotic, lots of people, trying to get what they need but I was very impressed. We usually ate around 9:00-10:00 ish. All what you'd expect, hot 'English' breakfast, cheese, meats, bread, cereal, pastries, juices, yogurts but there's a few things that went above and beyond for me. Cava is freely available if you fancy a cheeky breakfast mimosa, smoked salmon freely available too. (I find that most places charge extra for salmon and fizz). Tea and coffee brought to the table and hot milk provided as standard. Egg station - so you can get an omelette made with your choice of filling fresh in front of you and fried eggs are done to order. I personally really liked this, I hate picking up a fried egg that looks like it's sad and been under a hot plate for hours. I felt like all these little extras, with the plethora of choice in the first place made it fantastic. There's so much fruit, bread, cheese, meat, the choice really is superb.",

It is in a valley so day are slightly shorter than some place.\n\nFood is good and the breakfast buffet is plentiful and varied with the usual resort pancake and egg station.\n\nNo inflatables in the pools.\n\nThe location is about a 400m walk from the sea / beach. This is fine but the walk shows some of the resort of Morgan seems to have been abandoned in its development.\n\nThe restaurants at the beach and the new town(the bit that looks like Venice.. allegedly..yeh right.

Bed was super comfy, a great balcony with comfy loungers, and a great selection for breakfast (Would advise going a little earlier to avoid the rush at peak times). Staff were very welcoming and helpful. My only slight issue was with the cleaning of the rooms - Our dirty cups/glasses were not replaced everyday and our towels disappeared over the stay (not sure why they were taken but not replaced). It still gets 5* from us though!",

The other detraction was the the awful early evening entertainment: we were subjected to \"club singers\" every night, butchering pop classics on cheap keyboards. The hotel should hire some of the local (surprisingly good) street musicians instead, would have been much easier on the ears.",

The larger salt water pool is heated enough that you don't go into shock if you go in it early on, the other fresh water pool is the same with enforced quiet areas also. A 'no towel' policy applies to the sun beds until 10am also, the lifeguard removes towels before that time that have no one on or near them. This means you can actually lie in past 7am and still get a lounger by the pool!\n\nThe life guards run competitions and fun activities every hour or two and loads of kids get involved.\n\nThe diners are great, all you can eat with freshly cooked options like omelette in a morning and burgers etc in an evening.\n\nThe staff are extremely friendly and helpful.\n\nThe walk into town takes 15 to 20 minutes depending how much wine you've had, loads of varied restaurants in town to try. The beach is well maintained and has options for pedalos with slides and so on. While not part of the hotel it all adds to its appeal.\n\nAll in highly recommended.",

Soundproofing is decent for the window but they neglected the door and so every time maintenance or anyone gets off the elevator you hear it loud and clear.  The \"half board\" buffet is decent quality but it's a bit of an annoying charade to hand vouchers at a \"5 star\" resort.  Everything is a hassle. That and they charge extra for your drinks at the buffet (even water).  On the whole the staff are kind. The cleanliness of the rooms leaves a little to be desired",

However, on this occasion, this was sadly not the case.\nThe first room we were offered, although nice and clean,  smelt like cigarette smoke and there was very little privacy and so we were kindly moved to a second room. This room had an ant infestation and when I informed reception of this they sent maintenance who sprayed the room with ant killer. We were then informed the problem had been dealt with. Unfortunately, the problem had not been dealt with and there were still a significant number of ants crawling over the surfaces and around the bed. I, therefore, therefore asked to move again. I was told by the manager that there were no rooms available and that the hotel was fully booked. I quickly checked online and showed him that I was able to book several rooms for my stay and he then changed his tune and offered me a ground-floor room but couldn't guarantee there were no ants. I informed him that for a 5-star hotel this was not good enough but I would take the room. When waiting for the room to be made up he managed to 'find' a higher-up room which we moved to. Fortunately, there were no ants but there was a very strong sewerage smell coming from the drains.\nExcept for the evening manager, the staff were all very helpful and the facilities were clean.\nI feel the hotel requires some maintenance as cracks are showing in the plaster, damp patches are visible on the ceilings and mould was present in all of the bathrooms we were in.\nFor a five-star hotel I expected better and always have experienced better so this time it was an exceptionally disappointing visit.",

If you accept that, I would imagine you won't be as disappointed.\nIt's a massive hotel but with no soul and certainly doesn't look or feel Spanish in any way. Just feels like any other large corporate hotel.\nPlus points, all the staff were friendly, professional and courteous.\nBreakfast was fairly standard fare, some items could be a bit hit and miss but a good selection.\nWe ate dinner only on the one night and it was very disappointing. Stone cold steak with stone cold mushroom sauce (not even sure how's it possible that these could be cold!) that was left uneaten.\nThe sofa bed in the bedroom was so uncomfortable that we had to request a mattress topper for it, they supplied a piece of foam. I wouldn't stay again for that reason alone.\nThe quiet pool area is in poor condition with tiles lifting from the bottom of the pool. Never seen this in a 5-star hotel.\nRoom condition was no where near what I would expect for a 5-star hotel, cleaning again a 3/5.

I travel 5 star hotels round the world and this one does not fit in that category whatsoever! Discrimination at the highest!\n\nArrogant and rude staff, managers backing the staff although staff being on the wrong! That just shows lack of professionalism with no equality especially for the management team. The company needs to review their decision in employing unqualified employees with no interpersonal skills. In addition to this the spa is at additional cost which is a joke for a hotel advertised as \u20185 stars\u2019! And the list just goes on!\n\nAbsolutely ridiculous this hotel has more red flags on the list\ud83d\udea9\nWhat\u2019s more appalling is that I see a lot of previous bad reviews here and yet the management have made false statements that will improve, however, I see no changes is in place! Surely if changes were to be made when people initially complained, by now I shouldn\u2019t be experiencing similar issues.\nI would definitely NOT recommend this hotel. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc",

Upon arrival you are warmly greeted by the nice staff who offer you a welcome drink while they inform you about your stay. Your luggage will be brought to your room for free if you'd like. The pool areas always have many available sunchairs even in busy periods. There are two pools+the childrens pool, both are very nice, one is salwater, and the other one is water with chlorine. Near the kids pool besides the \"VIC kid's club\", there is an arcade machine, a mini-billiard table, an airhockey game, and a candy claw machine. The breakfast buffet is nice aswell, there is a big selection of food aswell as drinks. As for the restaurants on the hotel, you will find 4. The 2 pool bars, the buffet and restaurant \"Fillini\". Both pool bars' kitchen open at around 13 and close at 16/17 if im correct. The buffet is called \"Around The World Buffet\" and serves differently geographically themed food every night, which is very nice. The restaurant \"Fillini\" serves italian food for both lunch and dinner. The hotel is located nicely within the mountains, and is near a nice promenade that leads to the city/beach. They have a free parking service in the basement level, which is very nice if you are renting a car. I can really reccomend this, especially if you are staying with younger children.",

                "review_text": "Hotel is great. A family room is two separate rooms (and bathrooms) with a shared lobby and access via the balconies which is perfect when you have teens / tweens.\nWe had half board and enjoyed both breakfast and dinner for 5 days. Good selection and the staff are all very friendly and accommodating. I didn\u2019t like the house wine by the glass so we bought a more expensive bottle and were able to put it away each night and enjoy it the following night.\nCommon areas are very spacious and separating the adult and child pools works well. There are activities and entertainment if you want them but you are not forced into it. Location is excellent and far less touristy than other places on the island.\nOnly gripe would be you only get free water in the room on the first day, this isn\u2019t replaced.",
                "owner_answer": "Dear Kathryn, we would like to thank you for staying with us and for sharing your impressions. It is fantastic to read that our comfortable family room, the half board meal choice, friendly staff, spacious common areas and the hotel\u00b4s  location close to the Mogan port were to your liking. We hope to have another chance to welcome you again. Kind regards",

We opted for half board and we were blown away by the quality of the selection  at breakfast and dinner. We are a family of very different palettes so it was perfect. Outside of the buffet meals, on the pool bars the service can be hit or miss we quickly identified that the much better service was at the zona tranquila pool and bar.\nAs for kids Club there was plenty,  unfortunately with it being our 5 year old  daughters first holiday abroad she struggled to intergrate with other kids who were mainly of Spanish origin, she enjoyed the kids disco and was completely fascinated by the evening entertainment which we all enjoyed.\nOn the whole , we loved the hotel , we have had a wonderful holiday and we hope to return again next year.",

The entertainment provided was very mixed. The karaoki was dire, the dance team and the acrobats were very limited, and a singing duo just sang along to a tape. One couple shone. They sang rock songs from the 80s and 90s. I forget their name but they were on on the Wednesday evenings. Our balcony was unuseable most of the day as the music from the children's area below was so loud we couldn't sit there. Perhaps rooms in that are should be allocated to families rather that an older couple like ourselves. We loved the quiet pool area and spent most of our time there, enjoying the pool itself, the jacuzzi and the bar. Breakfast was excellent.

                "review_text": "Stayed here for 4 nights in Feb 2022. The hotel has every amenity you could possibly want. It was relatively quiet when I stayed but as the property is so large there was never any crowds. Breakfast is buffet style and has all options you could want. Had dinner in the hotel on two night, options and quality was okay but nothing special.\nStayed in a superior room overlooking one of the pool. It was well appointed and maintained. Pillows were too soft for my liking so had to use 2/3 to be comfortable. Huge balcony so i chose to sun-bathe in the mornings before moving to the pool or sun deck in the afternoon.\nEvery single staff member I encountered were extremely polite and attentive.\nProperty is located a very short stroll from the beautiful town of Mogan with a large number of restaurants and bars.\nI would definitely return to this hotel!",

Prepare to wait 20 minutes.\nRaquel who works at the pool bar is possibly the world's grumpiest woman. She'll ignore you for 10 minutes before she begrudgingly serves you. I've deducted a star just because of her attitude. She'd be better put her on grass cutting duty or night security.\n\nThere's loads of sunloungers to go around but the pool man will still steal all your belongings if you leave anything on a bed before 10am.\nNot enough staff for a place of this size so don't expect 5 star service.\nThere's also a massive smell of sewerage all around the place and therefore lots of flies. Some guests had fly swotters with them at the pool.",

We spent most of our days at the pool on ground floor level across from  childrens pool. Lovely jacuzzi beside large swimming pool. Water temperature lukewarm so pleasant for swimming and we cud hear the music playing at childrens pool. There is also a quiet pool area on level 1 but we like to see the children enjoying themselves. Food was excellent and we also got 1 free night with 3 course meal at the Italian on site  restaurant during our stay, which we really enjoyed. We booked a superior room with pool view and was worth the additional cost. The only negative is the port is about 15 mins downhill but def worth seeing. Large supermarket 5 mins walk away.

Myself husband and childrens were greeting with friendly smiles as we walked through the door, the children got soft drinks and myself and husband a glass of cava. As we went up to our room there was a fresh fruit bowl and a bottle of cava on ice. The rooms are absolutely beautiful, the comfiest beds and the air con was a dream as it was so hot. We had interconnected rooms with the children and it was brilliant.\n\nWhen we went for breakfast every morning when we got back up the bedrooms were cleaned. The breakfast was unbelievable. The waiters are so lovely seat you quickly and you can eat literally anything you want. They cater for everyone.\n\nThe pool is stunning, lovely area for the children also the night pool\nFor adults and bigger kids which isn\u2019t too deep at all. It\u2019s the most chilled vive in the hotel. Of you wanted to go for a later swim we did and it was great. Nighttime entertainment stopped around 11ish but that was ok because we\u2019d wake every every morning.\n\nI\u2019d be very overprotective over my children especially when we\u2019re are away but the hotel is so safe, there\u2019s basketball (my kids fav) football volley ball, you name it they have it.\n\nI loved my stay even more then the 1st time\n\nThank you Raddison Blu, we shall see you next year \u2764\ufe0f",

Room's not clean like they should be, lot's of dust on wall lights, human hair in bathroom from previous visitors. During breakfast waitress not bother to offer you coffee and they not even bother to remove all used plates from the table, so you might end up having lot's of empty plate before anyone going to notice. During dinner please check your bill if ordering any drinks because they tend to overcharge by putting on bill drink bigger than you drank so for example we had 25cl beer but on the receipt was 45cl beer. So very unprofessional!!! Selection of food for breakfast is very limited and luck of choices...the same every morning. Dinner is not bad but definitely not perfect for 5 star hotel!!! I personally not recommend this hotel for few reasons, overpriced, poor cleanliness, unprofessional waitress with very limited English, food choice average!!!",

We won\u2019t be staying at the hotel during the day for rest of our holiday. We\u2019ll go elsewhere to sunbathe.\n\nIf you have kids under 5 this is ideal. If they are between 6-12, forget it. There is nothing for them to do at the pool. There\u2019s no jumping on the inflatable, no li-lows allowed and no masks with snorkels or similar allowed. There is no accommodation for older kids at all.\nIf they play football, then they can do that all day. If not, well, good luck.\n\nThe straw that broke the camels back was dinner tonight where we, as a family of 4, were shown to our seats, to be sat down only to find there were 2 place mats set, and left to get on with it. I then went to the next table for 4 and grabbed all the cutlery we required.\n\nThis is billed as a 5 star hotel, and yes, it almost does meet most of the criteria, however, if you have a family of older kids, they will be bored completely after 2 days, unless they happen to like football.\n\nTo say I\u2019m disappointed would be an understatement.\n\nWill I be back? Absolutely not!!\n\nKenny",

We had a lovely room overlooking the pool with an extended patio area\nthe beds were super comfortable I liked the soft squishy pillows but the husband wanted a firmer pillow and that was no problem because it was changed as soon as we asked..  cleaning by the maids was good I wouldn\u2019t say perfect because often our bathroom wasn\u2019t swept properly. The breakfast is buffet style with chefs cooking eggs omelettes et cetera and I would say it was a fantastic choice all of the waiting staff were super helpful and efficient.\nThere is an enormous pool for children and families which seemed very well used whilst we were there there was still quite a few children who were on Easter holidays. On the upper deck there is a quiet zone Pool\nI cannot understand why it\u2019s just not for adults ? to me it seems completely pointless having a quiet area when the children can still come up and down and start using the pool..  admittedly the lifeguard in attendance was very quick to tell people when they were making too much noise , but  families with kids have got a choice of two swimming pools whereas if you\u2019re an adult on your own the likelihood of you sitting downstairs with the kids pool is unlikely.\n\nWe didn\u2019t use the restaurants in the evening so can\u2019t comment , we chose to walk into town each evening.\nI would recommend this hotel but I think primarily it\u2019s a family hotel .\n\nThe staff were all lovely \ud83d\ude0a and we enjoyed our stay .",

                "review_text": "Sadly the rudest service I've ever experienced in a hotel. At check in we were told one of our two rooms bookings didn't exist (despite me showing them both confirmation numbers) and was bluntly told that they had no rooms and we couldn't stay there that night. They outright denied the problem was anything to do with Radisson, multiple times. We were told we couldn't stay.\nThe booking was via British Airways who then had a long argument with the reception staff on our behalf, and it transpired that Radisson had received but failed to note the second room booking.\nThe hotel begrudgingly gave a second room (suddenly one was available) and we were told we would need to move rooms during the week. When we turned up at reception the next morning, as requested, to find out what moves would be needed - they had no idea who we were or what the issue was. Super frustrating!\nI've had plenty of experiences of bookings being incorrectly processed, but I've never been treated with such utter contempt as my family was here. No apology was given either. (British Airways on the other hand was faultless, and they couldn't have been more helpful!)\nMy advice is to avoid Radisson",

The pool in the quiet area is great for swimming, sunbathing and relaxing. The buffet breakfast and dinner both have lots of options and good quality food. The Fellini Italian restaurant on site was really good. Pretty good value hotel stay given all the facilities. Note some are extra cost however including the Spa.\nEvening entertainment ok but nothing special.\n15 min walk to the beach, lots of restaurants options nearby. Note I understand here in Puerto Morgan it is a bit more expensive than other places along the coast but still ok value to be found.\nSandy beach there is not that large and crowded. To the left there is a rocky area where much better to swim if you like clear water and seeing fish!",

Loved the architecture with the hexagons, wide open spaces and light! In a quiet location, surrounded by mountains and a short pleasant walk to the beach and marina. Peurto Mogan is just beautiful - the nicest resort we have stayed at in all the Canaries! Sympathetically developed from the 1980s, still has a large local population and we found it attracted locals from elsewhere in the canaries at Easter, a good sign that it\u2019s not just full of Brits and has local bars/eateries. We only ate at the Radisson buffet in the evenings 3 times - used half board for our lunch and went to the beachfront and marina at night. Food was great though, and very clean and efficient buffet. Would definitely return and recommend.",

The hotel is spotlessly clean.\nThe food in the restaurant remains of a high standard, but I have a particular shout out for Omah.  Since our last stay here in 2019 my wife now requires gluten free food.  Whilst there are options, it was Omah's intervention that ensured she got a great meal each night that specifically met her needs. Thank you Omah.\nWe'll be back for sure.\nCovid has had an impact on this small resort with some of the bars, shops not having reopened.

                "review_text": "Very nice and modern. Fun and big children pool, they have also salt water pool.  One thing is for sure. The food was great, drinks and cocktails were well prepared, great COVID safety awareness, nice and comfortable furniture on the pool area, bar and recreational area. The staff were very kind, and the location of the hotel is perfect. They also have a quiet pool for people without children that wish a more relaxed environment. To name other things that weren't that great, they were a little understaffed and the app to communicate with the reception was not effective. Better to use the good old phone to speak with reception. Needs some small maintenance on the rooms on small things like lamps that were rusty, mirror frame paint was falling apart and some small other things. For me one of the worst things were the cushions overlay on the room hammocks that were in need of replacement or a good cleaning but the rest was very pleasant and enjoyable. Had a very good time. Strongly recommend this hotel. Like Terminator's catch phrase \"I'll be back\".",

Was great since everything is right there.\nThe rooms are clean and everything is pretty up to date\u2026 walkways and kids pool and the sportsection need little renovation soon. If you depend on wifi then you will have trouble it\u2019s spoty and not really fast.\nRoom service is ok, but not great. I excpect more for 5 Stars",

The Covid-19 enforcement is really good too. They strongly encourage you to wear a mask all the time except when you are eating, drinking or on a sun lounger. The Pools are immaculate and even the family pool isn't too noisy. We took full board tickets for 7 nights and the rest of the time we went out into town which is just 10 minutes walk. The breakfasts are very good and the dinners are fine. If you have visited Turkish hotel buffets for similar hotels then you will not have the same standard but frankly you won't be disappointed. The staff are very professional and friendly. I have two minor criticisms, the first is that the drinks and lunch menu in the pool bar are over priced. The same is true for drinks in the evening with dinner. Do go for a walk in the surrounding hills and enjoy the Port in the evening. would we come and stay there again? Yes, of course we would.",

It is great that they offer half the resort for families and half for people who want a quieter experience. The staff are always friendly and welcoming. Still a pristine resort with something for everyone.\n\nBeautiful hotel in a quieter part of Gran Canaria. Although providing a resort feel is just a pleasant 15 minute pedestrian only walk into town. We found everyone helpful and charming from pick up at the airport to departure. Pristine room and facilities.\nRecommended.",

The only thing I'm not completely sold on was the glass bathroom walls with no lock (I have a toddler who was partial to popping his head through the door to say hello mid-shower!), but that's a personal preference!\n\nThe staff were very attentive and couldn't do enough for you. The food was also lovely with plenty of choice and it was different every night in the buffet restaurant.\n\nMy kids loved the pools, and the quiet pool was very peaceful. Unfortunately I ran out of time to sample the spa!\n\nThe hotel is situated a short walk from the beach, but it is very pleasant and seems much shorter than it actually is. There is a small supermarket that you can see from the hotel, so very handy for everything from nappies and wipes to extra suncream and drinks for the walk to the beach.",

Good tv with Android and IOS sharing from mobile.\nWiFi Good\nEnglish channel are just news.\nShower Good and beds are big and really  comfy.\nPools and good and clean with jacuzzi in both normal and quite pools.\n\nOnly went BB, thank God.\nFood at breakfast is buffet and is constantly luke warm to cold. Absoultley apualing for a 4*\n.....Radisson,  just turn heaters up and warm the plates.......its not that hard!\n\nArrived at 7pm, so chose to have the evening  buffet. At 24 Euros  each. In my opinion,  not worth it. Good selection but nothing special. Better going to a restaurant  for that money.\n\nDrinks are obviously going to be more expensive but not majorly compared with the high end restaurants.\n\nSurprised you have to pay to enter the Spa. Obviously if you wanted the massage etc , then yeah you expect an extra charge.\n\nTennis courts are also chargeable!\n\nI did get a birthday cake and bottle of red on my Birthday,  which I thought was a very nice touch. However I do think the customer service regarding the issue with food, was useless and still there's no explanation or improvement after lots of complaints regarding this issue which have been raised by other people.....check Trip Advisor.\n\nWouldn't call this hotel 4* but overall its nice but probably not value for money  tbh. We paid \u00a31600 for 2 people 7 nights Flying from Manchester  In Jan 2022\n\nTo add, just found out its a 5* .......lol",

The only very minor things that could have been better but were probably only personal to our preferences were the TV in our room had very limited English channels (all news channels) and we were unable to set up the Apple TV pairing.  Also we would have preferred an empty minibar/fridge to keep our own drinks cold. Otherwise we had a wonderful stay and will definitely be returning.",

There is a secure luggage room that we left our bags in whilst we went to sit at the pool bar.\n\nThe room was very clean and spacious. The bed was super soft which I like, but might not be to everyone's taste. Mini fridge and safe included in the room.\n\nPlenty of food to choose from at breakfast. I particularly enjoyed the egg station and the Pastry station. Fresh omelette every morning - yummy!\n\nWe spent our days at the 'quiet pool' which is at the other end of the hotel to the kids pool which was perfect for us. The sunbeds are quiet close together but there was room to move them slightly further away from other people if needed. It great that you can't reserve sunbeds before 10am so there isn't that mad early morning rush. The lifeguard does remove items left on sunbeds before 10am.\n\nWe visited the gym several times during our stay. Due to covid, only 4 people can be in the gym at any one time so you have to go to reception to book your hour slot. The popular times, ie early morning and before dinner get busy, so you do have to plan your trips. You can't just turn up like you would pre-covid.\n\nWe didn't use the salt water pool, the kids pool or see any of the evening entertainment shows so can't comment on those.\n\nOverall we enjoyed our stay l but I've removed 1 star as we encountered some little annoyances. For example, toiletries in our room weren't placed - we had to find a cleaner one morning as we were running very low on toilet paper. There's no drinking water taps around the hotel so we popped to the local supermarket to buy bottled water. We could buy water at the bar, but its far cheaper to buy at the supermarket (2-3 min walk). We also bought some alcohol at the shop to enjoy in the room pre dinner but annoyingly the cleaner didn't replace the dirty wine glasses the next morning.\n\nI appreciate my negatives aren't that major, but I do think its important to mention here.",

We preferred to sit outside as it was too noisy inside - full of families with children.\nAlthough it's family friendly resort they have one swimming pool just for adults far from kids pool, so you haven't even noticed there are children around.\nNice cocktails available for reasonable price.\nWe will be definitely back.",

I missed having a kitchen but the breakfast buffet spread had all you could want regardless of your nationality. The staff were fantastic from the front of house down to cleaners all always had a smile and greeting for you. The grounds are well kept and clean as are all the areas. Never seen a pool without towels on sunbeds before, even at 10:00. It has  2 pool areas of which 1 is classed as a quiet area the other for children with its own fun pool. The last time we were in Puerto Mogan 3 years ago the hotel was being built. I was a little apprehensive about coming back in case the hotel had a adverse effect on the area, this proved to be unfounded as the local area seems to have been enhanced by the arrival on this great hotel. Well done to all concerned.",

Breakfast has an amazing selection that is constantly topped up with fresh food and a nice touch was bottles of Cava so each morning started off with a bucks fizz..... well, you are on holiday!!!! We love the restaurants in town so didn't eat dinner and only twice enjoyed lunch by the pool but that too was very good. Staff are fantastic, friendly, bilingual and helpful and nothing seemed any trouble. It is a stretch of a walk from the town to the hotel but it's a walk we enjoy although some might want to be nearer or consider taxis.",

Not a huge selection, but the quality was good. Close to the shopping centre and the beach. The evening varied in quality, but was mostly good(except one night with some rather average singers). Overall a great stay and would be happy to return.",

Hotel is in a lovely location (40 minute drive from the airport) with lots of shops, restaurants and a nice beach near by. The rooms are very modern and spacious. We upgraded to a half board when we got there. Our kids love buffet restaurants so, even though the quality wasn't fantastic, there was always a good choice and we didn't have many complaints. Eating and drinking in the hotel is  a bit expensive but there is a store near by and you get fresh bottled water in your room. There are plenty of alternative places to eat, all within a 15 minute walk.\nThere is a good range of activities available in the hotel. We also liked the fact there was never any mad rush or getting up at stupid times in the morning to get a lounger by the pool.",

Or especially (for her) :)\nBig, very clean rooms with a balcony each, comfy beds, some entertainment in the evening (but not too long or loud), good food, mini disco and kids club for the little ones, daily yoga classes and a quiet zone on the other pool made it perfect for everybody's needs. But the biggest benefit of this place is the friendly and attentive staff - in all areas!\nThe only thing to improve would be more vegan/vegetarian/healthy snacks in the buffet area.\n\nIt's a ten minutes walk to the beach and restaurants. A supermarket is three minutes away.\n\nWe come back for sure!",

My kids are grown up, I've been through that annoying stage and certainly don't want to listen to other people's off spring, in an area where they shouldn't really be in the first place. Staff made no effort to 'control' or even advise them.\nLife gaurd is NOT present all day. Every 5 mins he dissappears off, with no replacement in place.\nMy only other observations would be on our room. We were expecting a double bed and got 2 singles pushed together, this doesn't work, is quiet disappointing and actually a bit of an atmosphere killer! The other observation is only 1x bin in a huge room (niggly I know).\nStaff are very helpful and pleasent.\nWe are B&B board and the breakfast turn out is superb; everything you could imagine x10.\nAs expected bar prices are much higher than the surrounding bars and restraunts.\nHalf a lager and lime and a double Grey Goose and coke was over 20euros.",

Extremely soft mattress gave me a sore back and low quality sleep. 2. Showers were fab but a door or curtain was lacking. 3. Breakfast was a shambles, terribly organised. The cereals and flakes even came in plastic packets! What on earth for, apart from generating more food and plastic waste? 4. The design was too harsh for me, all the angles and straight lines make it rather cold, and make it stand out from the environment.\n\nI could go on, but I won't. Would I go back? Maybe, but it certainly won't be my first choice.",

I've never really been in to soft mattresses but these you just sank into them and they just cradled you. I slept longer and deeper here than I have done in years.   They are massive too.\n\nThe pools are great and have a ramped access into them too.\n\nMogan is still a beautiful town with some brilliant shops. This is one of the world's best places to go see wild dolphins. We were out for just over a couple of hours and saw a couple of different types of them and had a great day.",

This was our 3rd visit there were 8 of us and we used to drink outside the hotel as we couldn't stand the wait for drinks so the hotel lost a lot of no money. The pool is ideal for kids. Checking in out was very quick.Dont know why there is a \u20ac300\ndeposit for mini bar it would be useful to be able to use the fridge wouldn't it be better to ask if you wanted the bar full and if so  charge the deposit.",

Only semi-decent act was the magician which proved to be popular but then staff could not handle the drinks demand and orders fell into chaos. There was not a huge amount of people but staff could not handle. They ended up serving my kids alcoholic drinks which we luckily caught.\n- The system of ordering drinks and delivery does not work. You often see people wandering about with your order not knowing who to take it to. This only applies to the bars however. In the restaurant it works well.\n- Eating outside is great but there are too many flies. They need to address this.\n- Rooms are generally clean with the exception of the floors. Floors are only swept daily and not very well. Not sure if its a time limitation or what but more effort needs to be made. A vacuum would make a big difference. Corridor floors also need to be addressed. I know people will pull in a lot of dirt and it's difficult to manage but in block 3 the gardeners have their storage room and it could be 2-3 days before the mess they made was cleaned up. Saying that all of the main public areas are kept very clean so there is no excuse.\n- Watch out for the grumpy lifeguard. Safety is priority but this guy is a real grump. All other lifeguards are good.\n\nThe hotel wants to be 5 star but somehow doesn't quite make it, they have some improvements to make.",

We stayed here soon after it opened and there were some teething problems, like having your room cleaned at 6pm one day and then 8am the next (we had gone out for a run and were surprised the room got cleaned again so soon, we hadn't even used our towels). Also the gym was quite small and often had no towels or water available (people tended to fill up bottles at the gym, regardless if they were using it or not).\nBreakfast was included and had everything you could want and was generally very nice. The Italian resturant at the hotel was also quite good (again we were there opening week before Christmas, so were the only people there, which was nice).\nOverall a nice place, it is getting busier and with that comes the annoyance of other guests being around.",

And it is quite far (15-20 mins walk) from the pretty village of Puerto Mog\u00e0n and its lovely beach. The premises do not highlight that you are in a selective place. Everything outside looks sterile. On the \"upper deck\", artificial grass could certainly not be avoided due to the climate, but no real privacy there, where you hear everything from the \"activity pool\" on the ground floor. The architects' sole accolade is for letting the natural breeze coming from the sea upwards the valley to the hotel. It is certainly a good place for business reasons -- just wondering why in this case choose the relatively secluded Puerto Mog\u00e0n compared to other places on Gran Canaria -- but not for holiday reasons or a simple pool holiday.",

The room was great (1328) - specious and clean with a massive balcony, which had the sun on it until at least 3pm. Although it overlooked the children\u2019s pool (we were holidaying with a well-behaved 7-year old) it wasn\u2019t at all noisy and didn\u2019t distract from an extremely relaxing and pleasant stay. Both breakfast and dinner were fantastic - a plethora of tasty treats to choose from, which varied enough from day to day. Although the hotel was full, it never felt too busy at any time in the dining area. The Italian restaurant Filini was equally delicious and worth sampling. We enjoyed our stay so much that we have already booked to return, something I have never done before. Puerto Mogan was a short (easy) walk away and definitely worth exploring - such a beautiful place. Across the road was an excellent Super Dino shop that sold everything needed. The staff were exceptional and made our stay even better. If you are thinking of booking this hotel, do so; you don\u2019t regret it.",

                "review_text": "The hotel is new, only 16 months old. Its a huge place, very modern and exceptionally clean. Rooms are contemporary and well appointed. We loved the 50\" Samsung Smart TV with YouTube, really helped at times with the kids. Hotel WiFi throughout rooms and common areas was strong and stable. Beds were very comfortable, my only small gripe would be the super soft pillows but pillows are subjective anyway. Bathroom large with wet room shower. We had a fantastic large balcony overlooking the pool, great for watching the sun go down worth a drink in your hand. There was a gym, running track, tennis courts and a climbing wall. Entertainment every night. Poolside bar offering food and drinks served to your sunbed if you wish. The main restaurant offers high quality food. We were half-board, the breakfasts were vast and offered every conceivable breakfast you could want, dinner is a buffet with a different underlying theme each night. There was so much choice, starters, salads, mains, deserts; hardest bit was not trying it all. Hotel is located in a small beach village area, far away from some of the busier more commercial resorts on the island. This was a bonus for us, the hotel and area was full of couples and young families, no rowdy groups at all. Lots of Spanish holiday here too, which is a good sign. The beach is an easy 15 min walk from the hotel to a small bay sandy beach with great shallow sea, brilliant for kids. Lovely vibe down there, lots of bars and restaurants and very pretty marina. The hotel staff are all extremely friendly and helpful, nothing was too much bother. Wasn't the cheapest holiday we've had but it definitely was one of the nicest places we've ever stayed at, so money well spent I think. We wouldn't hesitate to highly recommend the Radisson Blu, thanks for an awesome holiday!",

Huge balconies too with sun loungers which is great. Also my mum is coeliac and the range of gluten free options in the breakfast was amazing, it had a separate toaster and microwave.

                "review_text": "Overall I enjoyed my stay at the Radisson Blu Resort & Spa, Gran Canaria Mogan.\nLarge resort, beautiful, relaxing, spacious\n\nThe worse thing...Breakfast is a daily disaster. Think the different happy faces on the breakfast information card given at check-in with the different smiley faces (happy to sad) are representative of the faces of the staff at breakfast time. At peak time, they are stressed. The service was so uncoordinated overall.\n\nThe sliced fruit was disappointing. No variety and usually empty or the slices of the fruit were gigantic. Who needs a half plate size slice of watermelon?\n\nThere were BBQ tongs (very long) for guest to use for the buffet food. Difficult for children to use and often they dropped them on the floor (and put them back). These types of tongs are not at all appropriate for a buffet.\n\nThere were next to no labels on food for breakfast where it mattered. There were some items that were out that even the staff didn\u2019t know what it was. Labels were on for dinner though.\n\nSliced meat and cheese were kept at room temperature, start of breakfast to the end.\n\nThe orange juice constantly ran out and the bottles brought out were not cleaned to the touch. Very sticky. Overall the drinks are in the wrong area of the buffet. They should be in the back where the gluten section is in my opinion\u2026.out of the way...especially if they have to be refilled frequently. I nearly saw about 12 bottles nearly crash to the floor.\n\nALL of the eggs, any way you had them were pretty much overcooked.\n\nPancakes and Waffles, cold and burnt. The pastries/doughnuts were lovely...tasty but self served from a distance with those super long BBQ tongs again.\n\nDinner was pretty decent but at 30Euros...was way too expensive...grossly overpriced for mostly side dishes on the buffet.\n\nThe grounds were very clean but the housekeeping was not the best. Beds were changed every other day...which was good. Floors weren\u2019t cleaned properly though. The floors outside each room looked worn as well as they haven\u2019t been cared for.\n\nOur beach towels were taken and not replaced on the 2nd day.\n\nAlso my particular housekeeper kindly helped herself to my chewing gum everyday since buying it. It became a joke with my partner. 3 sticks missing one day, 2 sticks missing another...out of a 15 pack of gum, I only had 2 sticks...she or someone else had half of the pack.. Needless to say, although not entirely a big issue I did feel a bit uneasy about leaving things about.\n\nThe pools were great\u2026.quiet and non quiet pools. The evening adult entertainment was average. They appear to not always kept to the schedule of the children\u2019s events though despite them being posted.\n\nAgain, overall, the hotel, location and amenities were great. Having stayed at other hotels, the standard of service were weren\u2019t the best for a 5 star hotel...at least in the housekeeping and kitchen. The food was disappointing but there are plenty of nice cheap restaurants nearby.\n\nWould I visit again, perhaps...yes. Recommend\u2026 depends on what you are after in a holiday.",

He then proceeds to take it away and 100% either throws it in the microwave or oven to defrost quickly. How do I know that? Because 1) fresh strawberries aren't mush 2) fresh strawberries dont taste or look like that. But hey, it's 2022...maybe it identifies as \"fresh\" and not frozen/defrosted smh.

They might of had a problem in the past but wasn't an issue when we were here.\nThe breakfast was very good with the most options I've ever come across. All the usual breakfast items but also whole salmon ( 2 types), pate, meatballs, and a whole Scandi section.  They had fresh OJ in pitchers, but if that wasn't fresh enough for your taste they had a juice press.\nALL the staff were exceptional! Polite, friendly, helpful, professional and ready to smile and share a joke. Actually, I felt the whole (beautiful) town was one of the most friendly of places.

They have lots of event happening most of the time.\n3 multiple nice restaurant and bars.\n\nNeed improvement\n1. They have very weired parking place. If your room is on other side of resort then even worst for you.\n\n2. We were 2 families and booked 2 rooms. They gave us both rooms pretty far and when asked ... They said ... You did not request both room together. ( I have never request such a thing )\n\n3. I had booked this restaurant to celebrate my wife's birthday. I bought 1 cake from outside and handed over to their restaurant and order one cake in resort restaurant itself. We wanted it to be special and restaurant/resort lost both the cakes. In response they just said they will not charge us for the cake (which they never delivered)\n\n4. They found the cake next day and left us in our room. By the time we came to room (11 pm ). It was spoiler and we had to throw it.\n\nMay be my expectation was too high with a 5 star resort and I am very disappointed.",

Fish was delicious!!!\nThe team doing the pool/outdoor areas activities were great. From aqua gym which was fun to water polo in the pool. And football, archery, volleyball and rock climbing all on site.\nThere is a quiet area with massive sunbathing and pool area. A gym. A full size tennis court. Pool tables and table tennis table which the kids loved!!\nThere was evening entertainment which to be honest we didn't really see as we were too tired, but it was not loud and couldn't here it in our room.\nWe were half board but you are able to switch your evening meal to lunch, which then enabled us to walk down to the port (10 mins) and have food there. The restaurants in the actual port area are very good, again the fish is very good!!\nThere is also a supermarket about 5 minutes walk away which we used to get water and snacks (was cheaper) and there are some clothes/perfume/souvenir shops.\nWe'd hired a car and travelled off the beaten track right up into the hills which are beautiful. Lots of little taverns and friendly people.\n\nThere is still a lot to say and do but I would recommend this place to anyone. This is the only review I've ever done of a hotel so I must be impressed!!!\nOh, and the waterpark is not far away, if you go buy some water shoes there cheaper than at the market), and its worth investing in the 'fast pass' arm band, as some of the rides had quite a queue and we literally walked straight to the front meaning we got lots more turns on all the rides instead of being stood in a queue. And take a picnic, because we only bought 2 diet cokes and that was 10 Euros!!!!! God knows how much the food was!!!\n\nGreat hotel, great holiday, great people!!! Nothing else to say!!!!",

I do think the hotel will need to work a bit harder to keep their 5 star rating though. We have over the years stayed in a lot of five star hotels and there are a few things which could cause trouble. when we arrived it was very calm and lovely but it soon became extremely busy and i feel the staff is not really coping. Breakfast buffe very nice but very crowded and long queues for for example pancakes. No breadrolls for breakfast which meant half cut bits of bread lying around. Sticky serving spoons which frankly is unhygienic.\nBoth my husband and I had a massage in the spa which was nice but therapist did not know a word of english? It was the same with some of the restaurant staff and cleaning staff. If you pay a lot to stay in a five star hotel you would expect the staff to know basic english.Some reviews regarding the cleanliness are true, the rooms never really smelt freshly cleaned.  The hotel still deserves a five star rating since all of the above comments are easy to deal with.\nSusanne and family",

It looked good, however the food tasted bland across the board; we missed more seafood options as well.\n\nNot so much the fault of the hotel as they do try to fight it, but beware that a significant number of guests are \u201creserving\u201d their beach chairs. At peak times, this might mean that you won\u2019t be able to relax by the pool while a third of the chairs are actually unoccupied.\n\nOverall, not perfect, but absolutely nice and will consider staying here again",

                "review_text": "This is a superb hotel situated in the lovely picturesque town of Puerto de Mog\u00e1n about a 5 minute walk from the beach and the harbour.\n\nThe photos of the hotel really do not do it justice, the grounds are just beautifully filled with fauna and it\u2019s stunning to look at, with a real tropical feel\n\nWe are a family of three and we decided to upgrade to the junior suite and stayed in 9030, the room was very good and the private garden was beautiful and very secluded. The room was not perfect and there are a few minor issues that maybe should be addressed. Firstly, there is a lack of electrical sockets and in this modern age we do need them for all our devices and secondly the wiring under the table and beside the fridge is pretty ugly. But these are not gamechangers and we loved the room.\n\nThe hotel has two large pools in different areas of the grounds, we stayed by the \u2018noisier\u2019 pool as it was closer to our room, but it was not noisy and getting a sunbed was not an issue. Both pool areas are lovely.\n\nAs we had upgraded our breakfast was served in the blue building near to our room and what a lovely breakfast it was with a huge choice of cereal, fruit, cold meats, bread, eggs, juices, churros (which my daughter loved) and sausages / bacon etc if you fancy a fry-up. Fresh coffee is served to the table and there\u2019s even a decent decaf on offer.\n\nWe were half-board and dinner was served in the large main restaurant in the main building. The restaurant is beautiful, especially the outside area. There are 2 seatings, the first is from 6.15 to around 7.30pm and the second after 8.15pm, upon arrival you choose your seating and then you get allocated your table which you keep for the duration. This works really well and helps to avoid a mad free-for-all at dinner. Again, the food is really good for something on this scale with a huge array of choice. We had roast pork, lamb, kebabs, paella, pizza and fresh fish, there\u2019s also a great salad bar and a dessert station that includes some very good ice cream. Of course, it is not going to reach the standard of a half decent restaurant, but last year in Turkey the food was so bad and so chaotic that we were forced to eat out more than 50% of the time, not here, we only ate out twice in 10 days.\n\nLunch however, does need a bit of work, the pizza that my daughter ordered was full of red pepper and was pretty awful and the sandwiches ordered from the bar by the lower (noisy) pool were pretty tasteless. Huge portions, but no taste and very little choice too.\n\nBut the reality is that no hotel is perfect, but this one is really not that far off.\n\nThings we\u2019d recommend on your stay:\n\nThe Puerto Morgan Submarine \u2013 Forget the mixed reviews, it\u2019s fantastic, going down to 25 metres and well worth the money. If going from the hotel allow 15-20 minutes to get there as it\u2019s a deceptively long walk as it\u2019s the other side of the harbour, it\u2019s cheaper to book online\n\n70\u2019s Buggy Tours \u2013 Well deserve their 5 star rating on trip advisor. It\u2019s a great adventure into the mountains and it is something that families or couples will enjoy. Great scenery, two lovely men that run it and the buggies are great fun to drive (full review on trip advisor).\n\nPrivate Taxi from airport \u2013 We used Zip transfers and at 45 euros we felt that it was great value as it\u2019s a fairly long drive on a TUI coach with all the stops (as we found out on the return).\n\nHire a car \u2013 We hired one for 4 days using Inauto at 157 euros, couldn\u2019t fault them and they delivered it to the hotel.",

It's in an ideal location for access to town and the beach and the weekly market more or less starts outside the entrance . If i was to be picky , the rooms could probably do with a freshen up , but they're lovely big rooms and house keeping are excellent at keeping them spotless . We would really love to visit again",

The whole place is set out in the form of a small village , surrounded by lush greenery which makes everything look lovely. Breakfast was great , with a huge choice , and lots of good local restaurants for evening meals in the picturesque local village ..great service too and friendly staff...only slight disappointment was to be made to pay extra for safe in room? ( What hotels do this any more? Should be free service like every other hotel) Bizarre, and at odds with the high levels of customer service elsewhere.. apart from this, highly recommend this hotel ..",

All lovely and the waiter and Maitre D in buffet restaurants. Even the cleaning staff are lovely.\nWent end Feb -start March.\nClean area and Mogan is known as \"Venice of Gran Canaria\".",

We've stayed in a few places before during those dates and this was definitely above and beyond! The cherry on top was the fact that hotel staff even provided batteries needed\ud83d\ude42!

This year in February there were plenty of free sunbeds (last year in October they were actively moving towels that were put out before 9am). Very comfortable beds. Could do with a slightly firmer pillow. Good size room and wardrobe. Breakfast buffet good with plenty of staff. Love the grounds of the hotel - lots of trees, feels like an oasis.\nNegatives: just for British visitors - only 2 English TV channels, BBC news and Sky. 20 German TV channels, so brilliant if you/your children are studying German at school. Tricky to get into the wifi if you have an iPhone - you have to go to a separate site - make sure you ask at the desk for detailed instructions/ring reception.",

We swapped a lot of days dinner for lunch so we could go out in the evening . Plenty of things for our 10 year old to do during the day .  Evening entertainment is not for us but then we never like it anywhere we go so it\u2019s no reflection on this hotel v others.  Hotel is very large with 2 pools and 2 different places to have your meals so stops it being same same every day.    Beautiful visual looking hotel including the grounds. Very well maintained. My only complaints ( so minor )  : tennis was expensive, information regarding the facilities at hotel not easy to find and the app didn\u2019t work and the bowling needed to be open longer than 1hr 30 a day.",

Plenty of flowers and plants. Found nice mantis from flowers. Nice pool area, which wasn't even full of \"reserved\" towels from elder people. :)\n\nHotel is a bit of mix of old and new. There are some activities offered, like bowling or spa and treatments. There was couple friendly hotel cats in hotel premises. Always nice bonus.\n\nHotel room was ok. Bit too cold during the nights, especially the floor which was tiled with ceramic tiling. We traveled during end of march, so coldness in the room was probably due to time of the year.\n\nI would probably choose same hotel, if I would go again this area.",

The rooms are cleaned thoroughly every day.  There are lots of ramps in the hotel too which is handy for buggies.\nThe pools are so beautiful and there are always lifeguards around. The pool bar food choice is extensive and the vibe is so relaxed.\nThe spa is so relaxing and treatments amazing.\nThe location is so close to the beach and marina, and the walk is a pedestrian promenade which is excellent for families.\nThe service, what can I say except excellent?  The staff are always on hand and with a smile.                        I had an exam while on the trip, and the staff were all helpful especially Mr. Eduardo Mart\u00ednez who was so accommodating and eased my nerves. The only thing I would change is next time, I would add HB as the food was so good and so varied with lots of vegetarian options and dietary info specified,  we ended up eating there a few nights rather than going out for dinner.\nWe are a family who travels a lot, and obsessed with this hotel, it just has it all and we will definitely be returning.",

                "review_text": "A lovely hotel with nice people working here and they do their best to help. But the hotel is ruined by the Shambles at evening meal. A few people are ruining the name of the hotel by not knowing how to organise the restaurant. Breakfast is great for myself as I have a suite here so a special breakfast restaurant. I have a bottle of red wine mostly every night. The price they charge is 21:40 euro. The same bottle in the super market is 6:50 euro. In my almost ten days here I have seen one other table having wine. Food they have is acceptable but I have known a lot better. As the days have gone by after writing my first things about this hotel I have come to the conclusion that the top brass does not know what is going on. My lady and I was put in a suite overlooking a house with six dogs. I have asked three times reception about these dogs barking. They tell me they have had many complaints and offered to change our room after seven days. We are not young and can't understand why this hotel would put us in these rooms knowing it would upset us. Why would they do this??? To late to change with all the packing etc. We got used to the dogs and like the suite so we will stay till the end...  But the shambles In the restaurant has not ended.  Tonight at Evening meal we saw a young couple 'who like us was given a table for their whole stay and like us was told to leave the table because some other people had booked it. SHAMBLES...... don't let all this put you off booking this hotel as it really is a lovely place if you are prepared to fight for what you want. We are still here and hope nothing else goes wrong . But  when you pay almost two thousand pounds for ten days like we did you should expect better.   Hope you all have better luck than we are having when you book this lovely in hotel.   Rick.         ...My second from Last night and getting ready to go down to the restaurant ..I feel sick and am worrying what will happen this evening as last night we were treated quite bad. I of course could be a coward and stay away and just go hungry. No I will go and take a chance.    Maybe get back on comments tomorrow.....wish me luck.",

If you stick around after dinner as well there's usually some interesting entertainment tapping in the downstairs bar. I'd also like to mention that I loved the built-in caves with the waterfall inside.",

Rooms excellent and well equipped.\nOne slight grumble although the bar downstairs was open till 1pm the reception bar which was magnificent and was only open 5 till 11 could do with opening till 12 minimum.

Here are our thoughts:\n\nPositives\n- overall hotel is finished to a high quality - it feels well updated and well taken care of - not tired like many resorts where the reality can be very different from the photos\n- food is generally good quality, especially for a buffet. Breakfast buffet was particularly good.\n- lots of amenities including several pools, several restaurants and bars, gym, tennis, and kids club\n- although quite expensive to stay here, stuff is quite well priced once you are here eg around 5-6 euros for a cocktail\n- the bar in the main lobby has a fun G&T menu\n- we appreciated pretty balanced mix of families with young kids and more elderly couples\n\nThings to be aware of\n- grounds a very large so you end up walking a lot\n- there are no views of the sea from the hotel, but from the main pool you can be downtown with a 5-10 mins walk\n- WiFi is pretty bad - hard to get a connection and even when you do, the speed is slow (less than 1MB/S)\n-Beds are quite uncomfortable in the family suites. Two single beds put together and very very noisy (plastic cover around bed) and creaky when you move",

As you can be allocated a particular table for dining and at a specific time there was no need to be rushing down to dinner looking for a table . Mog\u00e1n is itself a pretty little town , quiet but very picturesque and has a lovely beach surrounded by nice bars and restaurants. All the staff at the hotel  were extremely helpful and courteous and managers would be on site daily to ensure all was going well and are very approachable if you needed to raise anything - which would be doubtful considering how well run this hotel is .",

Lovely relaxing atmosphere but kids were also well looked after. 10 minute walk to very pretty harbour.\n\nReasons why not a 5 star:\n\n- Rooms very very noisy, neighbours/maids seemed to be dragging furniture around for hours every morning. Lie in was impossibie. Bed was way to hard for me and had a sore neck and bad throughout the stay\n- No decent outside areas for eating/drinking in the evening. I like a nice views and you're lower than ground level so its not possible.\n- Cost for safe is a bit steep and wifi is rubbush\n- Rarely tongs for the bead at meal times?\n- Now my biggest bug bear - the smell. Mogan STINKS. Of sewage. Especially in the evenings and sometimes our room smelt foul but actually never from the bathroom drains (?). It seems something happens at night that makes the resort unbearably smelly. Did it ruin my stay? Probably yes. I believe this is the fault of the new radisson hotel which is a huge shame for the cordial.\n- cat poo around the pool areas stank as well. (Note to the incredibly rude german family who thought it would be acceptable to throw it next to our beds) Such a shame as the hotel has set up designated cat areas to keep them away from guests/happy which is great.\n- lots of sunbed reserving and we found it difficult to find beds in the sun.\n\nOverall a great stay and would definitely return if the sewage issue is rectified in the resort.",

This is overpowered by the noise of children playing in the nearby school!  The food is excellent and having a dairy 'milk' allergy they have guided me towards the foods that I can have!  The staff are constantly going that extra mile to ensure that your stay is one to remember, also the next time that you return you can attain a type of club card that gets you ten percent Off the next time that you return and it appears that there are more of these hotels in the same franchise so you can benefit when going to the other hotels as well ! lots of things to do on site also! Someone talked to me yesterday and stated that this is their fourth year here and do not think that they have seen everything yet as there is so much to do!",

Beautiful gardens..almost like a fata morgana. An oasis of peace an tranquility. It's a nice stay for couples and people with children. There are lots of activities for children. Food is fantastic! If you're vegetarian or meat lover. Breakfast and buffet at \"Tamarona\" main buffet restaurant is great. Lots to see and taste. There are little information boards at each dish giving you the information you want to know when you are intolerant for fish, milk, nuts or gluten. Also there is a great menu at \u00e0 la carte restaurant \"Los Guayres\". And if you want a nice cocktail \"Fataga Discobar\" is the place to be! The location of hotel Cordial Mog\u00e1n is great. It's a 7 minutes walk to playa de Mog\u00e1n and a 3 minutes walk to the shopping mall (small but everything you need is there to find). Just follow the boulevard. A place definitely to recommend and I am coming back to this magical place!",

                "review_text": "I have stayed in many hotels around the world - this is one of my favourite hotels.\n\nThis was our third stay at beautiful Hotel Cordial Mogan Playa \u2013 and I am sure that we will be back again next year.\n\nThe hotel is perfectly located next to the pedestrian walkway that runs into the charming little village, just about 10 minutes walk to the promenade.\n\nThis time we had a standard double room on the third floor (no 7321) with beautiful sea views and afternoon sun at the balcony (see my attached photos). The room was well equipped and comfortable. In the main bedroom there was a mini fridge, tea and coffee making facilities, a 32-inch TV, two comfy chairs, a table and desk. The wardrobe was a good size, and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was a good size and had a shower over the bath.\n\nThe hotel is always kept spotless both in rooms and the public areas. A huge congratulation to the whole housekeeping team!\n\nI notice that some reviewers mention that there is a problem with reserving sun beds by the pool early in the morning. We had no problem getting a perfectly located sunbed after breakfast around 11 AM. For us there was no need to get up early to reserve a sunbed with the beach towel.\n\nThe wifi was fragile \u2013 We never did manage to get it to work.\n\nIn summary, Hotel Cordial Mogan Playa a very well-run resort offering a high standard of quality and service. We loved every moment of our stay and would highly recommend this place.\n\nRegards\nSvein-Magne Tunli from Bergen, Norway.\n\n--------------------\nReview from 1018:\nMy favourite hotel at Gran Canary!\n\nThis was the second time my wife and I are visiting this amazing hotel in beautiful Puerto De Mogan!  Cordial Mogan Playa is first of all a very beautiful resort (see my attached photos and you will understand) and we experienced this time a very high level of service from all of the staff.\n\nOur room (no 7218) was very spacious and offered nice views and afternoon sun at the balcony. The room has also a spacious bathroom.\n\nBreakfast was excellent with a large choice of cereals, continental meats and cheeses and cooked eggs and meats, though a little busy if you arrive later than about 08:30 in the morning.\n\nLast time (March 16) the wifi at the hotel was something of a hit and miss affair. This time there was no problem with the connection at all but the capacity in the afternoon can be a little slow.\n\nIn summary, Cordial Mogan Playa is a very well run resort offering a very high standard of quality and service. I gave it 4 \u201cstars\u201d in my last review. This time it will be 5 stars!\n\nHighly recommended. We will be back!\n\nRegards Svein-Magne Tunli from Bergen, Norway.",

In the room, half the electrical outlets didn\u2019t work - we had to change rooms at one point, and had to pay extra for this. No coffee or tea in the room, anything you want you basically have to pay extra. We had to pay extra to take a towel to the beach. The elevator works inconsistently at times having to walk down the stairs from the 20th floor. The pool upstairs is disappointing - not as big as it looks like in the pictures. The gym is barely a gym, hardly any equipment. The one positive is that the front desk staff of the hotel are pretty nice and at least tried to address our concerns. There were 1 or 2 individuals that were extremely rude. The location is also descent because it\u2019s near the subway and near the beach.",

I was told o should pay in the morning to use the laundry service! pretty useless as I needed the clothes that evening. The room pictures are very deceptive. The pools are very small with only 4 sun Loungers around each! The gym is TINY and very old ! We came back to see a guest fighting with staff this is when I decided to leave. I am going back to the Arts hotel! AVOID",

Overly priced and not good at all. I would say the only thing that was decent was the breakfast. But besides that everything else was lacking.

When I called the receptionist to inquire about this, I was told that the hotel does not provide irons and that I would have to pay for laundry services if I wanted my clothes ironed. This is unacceptable for a hotel of this caliber. Guests should not have to pay extra for basic amenities that are expected to be provided in a hotel room. I would not recommend staying at this hotel if you expect to have access to basic amenities.",

It is for security (fire risk) and electric network limit reasons why we do not have irons available for our guests. We have a laundry service available, we pick up your clothes and give them you back during the same day. We also provide an express service if it\u00b4s more suitable for you, both pressing and laundry.\nWe wait for your news\nKindest regards\nSantiago Hern\u00e1ndez\nDirector",

I am staying at this hotel at this very moment.\n\nThe room temperature is at 27 degrees and there is no air conditioning in this room. And in the website of hotel it is clearly advertised as room consists of an air conditioner. It feels like you are inside a boiling room. I informed this to the receptionist multiple times and the lady at reception tends to ignore the all concerns I raised.\n\nAnd we requested to open the window for sometime until some cold air gets inside. And we were informed to stay outside of our room in the middle of night as we have booked a high floor room therefore as per the hotel policy we must stay outside in order to open the windows. So we went out of the hotel around 10pm and returned after 45mins, we were surprised to see that room temperature still at 27 degrees. It seems no one has even opened the windows. And we stayed outside for nothing and feels like we got deceived.\n\nThe staff is really rude and does not know how to treat to customers nicely.\n\nI do not recommend this hotel to anyone unless you want to ruin your holiday.",

For sustainability reasons the hotel has air conditioning in summer and heating in winter.\nThis year the temperatures have risen suddenly and we are currently in the process of making the change from hot to cold.\nI am so sorry that you did not receive an exceptional service from our Reception team as they usually receive many compliments regarding their warmth and friendliness. Please be assured that your comments have been noted.\nI hope you will give us a chance by staying with us again to show you that your unsatisfactory stay was an exception.\nAll my best\nSantiago Hern\u00e1ndez\nDirector",

The free minibar is something I wouldn't call a minibar.\n\nThe shower gel holder and shampoo stand was stuck to the wall with a little adhesive stick and fell off the first night. No attention to details I'd say.\n\nThe gym is the worse of it all. So much space, so few equipments. The only age-old full-body machine there is defect and unusable. You are stuck with an incomplete set of dumbells. You have couple cardio machines though.\n\nConsidering the 295\u20ac per night price tag, I'd expect far more than this.

The indoor pool is \"under construction\", the outside pool had a horrendous smell and was filthy so I did not use the pool for the week I stayed.

There is no kettle, tea/coffee provided either. I wish i had just forked out more money and stayed elsewhere where at least the wifi would work in the rooms but unfortunately i booked this last minute and didnt read the reviews beforehand. The two stars is for friendly staff and good location but other than that it is a complete waste of money as the most crucial facilities were the most dissapointing.",

Part of our guests do not require breakfast, this why we keep it as an optional add-on. At the moment of making your booking you can always choose a rate with and without breakfast. \nStandard rooms measure 25ms, which is above average for hotels in Barcelona, and they pack everything you will need for a great stay in the city, and they have drinking water as well as water in the minibar.\nI do hope you would reconsider your decision to not return to the hotel, we would be more than happy to see you return. \nKindest regards\nSantiago Hern\u00e1ndez\nDirector",

                "review_text": "The room itself was clean, a very vice view of the beach which has a funfair etc as we were on the 11th floor. From higher floors you can see the whole of Barcelona, seeing things like the Sagrada Familia which is nice but only when you are in the loft. The rooftop pool is tiny and not inviting to use, especially in colder weather. We had around 21-24 degrees weather and it was windy and not very clean. Only a few sun beds but regardless it was not a relaxing, open space. The main indoor pool with amenities like sauna is closed so that isn\u2019t an option. There is gym equipment but again, not much. The \u201crooftop bar\u201d is inside and basically a stall which has barely any seating so again, didn\u2019t use. The most ridiculous thing was that we had to pay for normal things such as glasses and ice; 3 euros for such things. They did not even have irons which was surprising as 1, it is a hotel and 2, it\u2019s next to a conference centre. This was an inconvenience as when travelling, things like needing to drink water or iron clothes are essential. The TV was terrible and is about as big as a laptop, no english channels available except one news show. The reception staff/service was awful, when I checked in they didn\u2019t tell me anything really. They didn\u2019t tell me check out times, wi-fi, anything about the hotel (pool, amenities, how to get around/to room), just simply had me pay the fee and gave me my key so that was not a welcoming experience; they almost view you as a burden. We booked a large room but this was just two beds rolled together on wheels and the AC wasn\u2019t very effective and you can\u2019t open any windows. The only positives of this place are the maids, the bellman called Juan-Carlos, the location which is 5 mins from beach and nearest metro. I did like how you can control the blinds to the windows and bathroom using switches but when so much is lacking elsewhere it seems like a bit of a cop out to seem modern. A lot of shopping/food/cafe options in the area due to the Diagonal shopping centre being next door. There is also a taxi rank right outside which is great. To get to central Barcelona it is approx 15 mins on metro (direct train) and 30 min drive to airport (30/35euro approx).The view is nice but will only be nice if you are on higher floors.\n\nAll in all, the location and room itself were good and I did have a good stay. However there is a lot of opportunity and potential for this hotel to improve.",
                "owner_answer": "Hello A Sahrma,\nAlthough there are many aspects of the hotel that you found positive, I am sorry that there are so many that you were not to your liking.\nI would like to personally apologize for this as we are always aiming and trying to satisfy our guests and go the extra mile, and it is evident that we haven't achieved that. Rest assured that we have taken immediate corrective action for our continuous improvement. \nWe sincerely hope we have the opportunity to restore your faith in us in the future.\nAll my best,\nSantiago Hern\u00e1ndez\nDirector",

The staff were very friendly, welcoming and helpful nothing was to much. We stayed on the 23rd floor with sea view, there\u2019s a small rooftop pool with amazing sunrise/sunset views.. it\u2019s a little cold when you first get in but you soon warm up. The Gym is very basic but does the job. The city views whilst going up in the elevator are spectacular. Lots of choice for breakfast including hot drinks, cold juices, hot food, cold meats and cheese, pan cake maker, cereal and large selection of fruit. The only reason I didn\u2019t give this hotel a 5 star is because there was a funny smell from the toilet, and the shower and toilet are only separated by glass e.g if someone gets up for the toilet in the night you will definitely hear everything.\nWe would stay here again, thank you to all the staff",

I am very happy to hear that our services made such a positive impression and that you had a memorable experience. We take pride in taking care of our guests and are very pleased that your expectations were highly met. \nAll our rooms are designed to take advantage of the daylight and that\u00b4s why the bathroom is open plan. But if you want privacy there is a full glass wall looking out to the sea with an electric blackout blind so you can adjust your privacy/lighting as needed. And there is also a door that you can close to have two different and completely private spaces\nWe look forward to hosting you again soon so we can share another amazing experience with you. Have a beautiful day!\nBest regards\nSantiago Hern\u00e1ndez\nDirector",

The pools are clean and maintained. Maybe there should be more sunbeds available. The air conditioning works great. The subway, tram, and bus stations are in the immediate vicinity, 5 minutes' walk. The beach is a 10-minute walk away. The shopping center is a few minutes' walk away with a large number of restaurants and fast food.

Or what would you expect if you book a 4 star hotel?\n- the room had a very nice view but it was old and dusty and also smelled dusty and old\n- there was almost no space for clothes\n- I had to pay 1,50\u20ac for a cup of hot water which is INCLUDED in literally every good hotel\n- the amazing gym: 3 devices in a very small room (why do they fake the pictures you can\u2019t call that a proper gym it was awful\n- the \u201eSpa\u201c was only one old sauna\u2026 so sad to call that Spa!\n- the rooftop is super small and you can\u2019t even eat there and it was closed even BEFORE 10pm which is also not cool because it says open till 10pm!!\n\nMy worst experience though: I contacted them in a friendly way and they did not care at all. I talked to them at the reception and they did not care, I changed my hotel to Morel one and\u2026 they were super friendly and sensitive like especially a 4star hotel should be! And motel one has less stars\u2026. I think it\u2019s sad to have grumpy and rude people working there, what are your hotel principles? Aren\u2019t you supposed to teach them?Princess treatment not included at all!\nI asked them if they could open the window while we are gone and not in the room because I catch a cold with the air conditioning and they said no, what\u2019s the problem when I\u2019m not even in the room?\nNow I\u2019m sick since a week because of the worst hotel experience ever!!\nAnd I payed 750\u20ac for 5 nights!\nI hope people read this because the worst thing is that I complained in a friendly way and they were rude, which is unacceptable for 4 stars. And I swear guys, I stayed friendly because I\u2019m not a stupid person, I have manners!\nYou don\u2019t deserve the stars, your people don\u2019t even know how to be a good receptionists!\nI also know hotel testers and have good connections so your bad that you treated me rude:)\nThe only people I want to say thank you to are the cleaning ladies, they were super nice.",

We are always aiming and trying to satisfy our guests and go the extra mile, and it is evident that we haven't achieved that.\nIt comes as a surprise that you did not find the staff friendly. I know how hard the team works and they provide a great service which is constantly recognised by our guests as we receive many positive reviews.\nRest assured that room cleanliness is a matter that we take very seriously and is of paramount importance to us and is something we follow very strict procedures about in the hotel. We have brought this incident to the immediate attention of the respective department head for improvement.  We have a small gym with the necessary machines for a non-professional training but for our clients to keep in shape (photos are updated and no retouched). About spa... we do not have a spa. We just just have two pools, the gym and sauna. And about the rooftop, the bar there is close during this period but you can have dinner at the pool on the 3rd floor, that closes at 23.00h. Pools are closed at 19.00h as you can see on the site, not at 22.00h!\nWe do hope you give us another opportunity to share a more positive experience with you soon\nAll the best\nSantiago Hern\u00e1ndez\nDirector",

Riding the elevator takes ages, with only three offered for what must be hundreds of guests. The breakfast was okay, but the large amount of conference guests at the breakfast table was astonishing. We only experienced one day of blissful calm, with the other six mornings being very loud and obnoxious. I'm guessing no one could really enjoy their mornings there. The staff also didn't really care about their customer's wellbeing. This is most definitely not a four star hotel, and I will most definitely not return.",

When you arrived at the hotel we were fully booked and for this reason we were unable to change rooms.\nWe would love for you to give us another chance and make your stay memorable.\nAll the best\nSantiago Hern\u00e1ndez\nDirector ",

Very nice because of the great and happy bartender that works there\n\nSo in general my experience was not so good but also not bad it just the problem is that the hotel doesn't feel like 4 Starts Hotel it feels like maximum 3 Stars Hotel",

Although we would have liked your stay to have been better, we are glad to see that it was overall positive.\nRegarding the bad smell, this is due to external causes as they go up the sewers. If this happens, you just have to contact our reception department as they have specific products for the smell.\nI do beleive that our parking pricing is competitive against other parking, especially taking into account that it is a full day price.\nWe would love for you to give us another chance and make your stay memorable.\nKindest regards\nSantiago Hern\u00e1ndez\nDirector ",

Nice mall right around the corner.\n\nNegative: Very large hotel with over 20 floors and only 3 elevators. Regardless of what time we tried to use them, there was always a long wait. Also, one had a constant leak coming from the ceiling which left a splash-worthy puddle on the elevator floor. Staff walked by and were not concerned. Wifi is more complicated to set up and use then it needs to be. Other hotels allow you to just connect. Here, you need to input a username and password. Only then can you TRY to use the internet....as long as your sitting in the right corner....facing the right direction. Otherwise, you're booted and have to try again.",

We have had over 280 guests located there for 5 days and everyday I received complaints about how they were mistreated by the hotel staff. Rudeness as its high, and poor attention. Repeated calls to have room service, as they wouldn\u2019t send up the order, annoying cards constantly not working.\nThe staff must be very burnt out as they don\u2019t care about their customers",

For any question you just have to contact reception but never use any tool to open it.\nAbout housekeeping department, I sorry if they moved your receipts and clothes. I will talk to the head of the department so that something like this does not happen again.\nWe hope we have the chance to meet your expectations in the future and make you have a very different experience.\nKindest regards\nSantiago Hern\u00e1ndez\nDirector",

One night came in around 10:30 pm and asked the restaurant in the lobby for coffee and dessert to go they said dessert could not be prepared to go but we could call room service or they could order for us we agreed. When arriving at the room phone rings a woman is screaming that that particular dessert is not available and hung up. Within 30sec she called back and asked if there was something else I wanted instead my answer was no. The next day we went out and upon our return found the room was clean but the wet towels from the floor where just hanging and not replaced.

It is a true experience to use the elevators with windows until level 23. service is usually good and so is the staff. Food at the fool is really nice. Rooms are okay.\nThe location of the hotel is not really close to the Center but if you combine it with a nice walk you enjoy this walk by the sea.",

Room, even though big, with comfy big beds and with nice view on Barcelona, has moldy ceiling, moldy tiles, toilet that doesn't stop running. Toilet was fixed on a second day after asking for a second time.\nGym is 5 machines cramped in a glass room. 2 swimming pools are too small for amount of guests this hotel holds.\nService is underwhelming, nothing is explained, in any hotel you are given information on where the facilities are, what time do those operate, here you are just given your keycard. I asked for a spoon, they don't know how to get you one.\nLocation is very nice, 12 minutes walk to the beach, 3 minutes to the metro, that gets you to the city center and next to a nice mall.\nParking is under the mall, \u20ac20 a day. If you don't mind a 9 minute walk, there is a parking garage 2 streets away, it said you  can park for \u20ac9 a day(August 2022), google: parquing subterrani ccib &diagonal mar.\nOh yeah, you have to wait forever for elevator.",

                "review_text": "The hotel is located in a 26-store building next to a shopping mall in a nice, though a bit distant neighborhood (~12 euro by cab to the city center). It has two small pools (usually almost fully occupied, and closed already at 19:00 / 20:00). Considering that due to COVID-19 the hotel wasn't fully occupied, I assume on a normal year one should be lucky to get a place by the pool.\n\nThe beach is some 10 minutes walk, and is fine.\n\nOur experience wasn't all positive. For four days we were lacking soap, although I mentioned that to the reception a couple of times. The WiFi requires a lot of operations to connect every time you go from one floor to another. Breakfast was decent, but they lack chairs in one hall, which is probably why we were asked to sit in the second hall despite free tables in the first one (in which the food is located).\n\nWe had to change the key cards several times. We have been told they were extremely sensitive to electronics, including close contact with a phone, they get demagnetized. A possibility of a broken lock was also mentioned by the reception, but never confirmed.\n\nThere were also some minor technical issues like the toilet door not closing, waiting time at the elevator, some cracks here and there - those are hard to fix and probably not worth it, but they added up to the total count.",

The hotel was very clean but lots of bits seem run down and the 2 pools are a lot smaller than they look in the photos! Transport links to the centre of Barcelona are brilliant with tram, bus and metro line on the door step and the Bleu Bar across the road sells lovely cocktails! Breakfast was really tasty at the hotel but cold which took away a bit of the enjoyment! As a base this hotel is great but if you are looking to spend a fair bit of time in the hotel I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for that! Staff were really friendly and helpful and the luggage room for checking out day is really handy if you\u2019ve got a late flight! Overall I would stay again but I wouldn\u2019t expect a 4 star stay!",

And also happy to see you appreciate our location, breakfast and specially our staff, always willing to do their best to make guests feel at home.\nWe are a urban hotel so we don\u00b4t have much space for swimming pool, and we have two... one of tem an infinity pool with an amazing view to the sea.\nThere is no coffee facilities or kettle in room, but you can take a coffee, tea, or whatever you prefer in our bar or even order it to your room as we have a room service opened until 22.00h\nWd hope you consider us for your next stay in Barcelona\nKindest regards\nHotel Barcelona Princess",

However, it was more the slow and uninterested response from staff that angered me.\n\nThe room itself had a nice view but tiny TV and very old fittings, while one day we were left without soap in the shower (this is refilled by cleaning staff).

When asked if we could have aircon as we were sweating in the bed the night before (which was as solid as concrete by the way) we were told \u201cyou can only have hot air\u201d we came away thinking we were going to have a relaxing break but in reality going home needing a break more than ever.

At this point, we were extremly exhausted and just wanted to sleep in a bed. then the receptionist said, we were too late. I dont understand now, what is the meaning of a reservation???? I mean, we would\u2018ve paid for the days we booked, and we even had to deposit our credit card for the reservation. Now what is the meaning of this reservation??? Very bad, very unfriendly people!!!! Then they also craved for another deposit of 600 EUR!!! Never again.",
                "owner_answer": "Hello Ernis,\nI am sorry for the situation that occurred upon your arrival at the hotel, but your reservation was for the night of the 25th. If on the day of the scheduled arrival the client does not show up at the hotel, the reservation is automatically cancelled in its entirety, so when you arrived there was no reservation in your name.\nAt that time if the hotel has rooms available, you can stay, but you must leave a deposit that will be returned upon departure.\nWe hope we have clarified what happened.\nBest regards\nHotel Barcelona Princess",

Lovely large room with a (sideways) sea view. Massive bed. High end fittings.\nThe only downside is that the en-suite could not be closed off from the room. There is a large glass door but the magnetic catch no longer holds. As the windows do not open we had to find other toilets \ud83d\ude09, not a problem - a little 'design over functionality' issue. Basic, but necessary \ud83d\ude44\nBreakfast is a generous buffet with lots of different dishes. There is no evening restaurant service but that's not a problem, all of Barcelona beckons.\nThe hotel is close to many restaurants  a huge shopping mall and loads of transport options. We walked to the beach every day, again lots of restaurants for tapas - and more. The pools are small, OK for kids. It's a city hotel not a beach resort.\nAltogether a great place to stay, thoroughly recommended.",

But if you want privacy there is a full glass wall looking out to the sea with an electric blackout blind so you can adjust your privacy/lighting as needed. And there is also a door that you can close to have two different and completely private spaces.\nOur Corner Bar is opened untill 1.00am, but we have a 24h room service and you can always ask for something to drink or some cold dish.\nWe\u2019re hoping to see you back very soon, given the good experience so far.\nKindest regards\nHotel Barcelona Princess",

Modern lighting, air conditioning and electric blackout blinds which can be closed from the bed :)\n\nHad breakfast one morning, a bit pricey but a lovely buffet. The food in the pool bar was nice, their club sandwich is fantastic! Food was cheap and delicious. Had food brought up as room service and only cost one euro extra per dish.\n\nThe pools are both quite small but this is a business orientated hotel so what do you expect. It's still very nice, the rooftop pool has a great view. Unfortunately the weather wasn't very warm when we visited.\n\nThe staff are friendly, the food was nice and the room is affordable. It's beside a beach, tram line and shipping centre. It's a little bit out of the way but it's worth it die to the price, services and features.",

When checking in, we asked the staff member if it was possible to accommodate us for missing our check in date the day prior due to our flight being delayed. The staff members at the front desk were extremely rude and not sympathetic at all to the unfortunate circumstances with our flight. They did not refund us for missing a day that was not under our control or giving us any type of accommodation for the inconvenience. Once arriving to our room the door lock would not lock. We called to request the door to be fixed and the front desk representative said a technician will be up shortly. The technician never came.. We went down stairs the next day to talk to them about the same issue with the door lock as it was not resolved when requested.The front desk insured us it will be done. It was extremely concerning for us as we are trusting the hotel to be able to leave our personal belongings in our room and the lack of consideration of not taking action right way is horrible customer service.\nThe only positive thing this hotel has to offer is the view from the pool but overall I would not recommend this hotel.

We had a room with a great view, the room itself was very spacious and clean. Very nice breakfast and good restaurant on the ground floor. 5minutes walk to the beach, 3minutes to the metro station. A fairly big shopping centre within 200metres. I'd definitely stay here again! Highly recommended.",

Ironing express is available, but it has its price. It should be possible to do it by yourself. Unfortunately rooftop pool was not open\ud83d\ude2a but there was another one, very small with nice bar for food and drinks (view is not that nice). On this floor is also the sauna. It takes about 10 min to walk to the beach. Metro station in the near, 3 min to walk. Best price/performance ratio in this category. Keep it up! \ud83d\udc4d",

                "review_text": "I was there for business travel and I found this property less than impressive.  The hotel across the street is a better option (I stayed there 1 night prior to transferring to this property).  If I had not been required to stay here by my employer i would have checked out after the first night.  My room's bathroom smelled horribly and continuously during my stay.  I alerted the front desk and they said it would be resolved - it wasn't.  I asked the housekeeper on my floor to help.  She tried, but the stench persisted.  Also, I had my do not disturb sign out everyday and I know for a fact that my room was entered each day - nothing was missing, but that's not the point.  Elevators were very slow.  You often waited several minutes before one arrived.  The positives:  The staff were generally friendly and helpful.  The breakfast was nice and had a decent selection.  The meeting rooms met expectations.",

But we are however disappointed to see your whole experience was not so good as we would like.\nAbout the smell in your room, we contacted our maintenance department who tried to solve this issue in the best way. That day the hotel was fully booked\u2026 otherwise we could have change you to another room, but i twas impossible.\nWe have also contacted our housekeeping deparment and after checking their files, we realized that we didn\u00b4t enter to your room every day, but the third. According to our hotel policy, even there is a \u00ab no disturb \u00bb in the room, our staff must clean it every 3 days.\nWe regret your experience with our elevators and we appreciate your patience and understanding.  We have 5 elevators, 2 of them from ground floor to business centre, Breakfast restaurant and meeting rooms and 3 panoramic lifts where you can enjoy the views of Barcelona.  We are in process of installing a lift intelligent system to optimize the client flow.\nWe would like you give us another opportunity to offer you the service that all our guests deserve.\nBest regards\nHotel Barcelona Princess",

For example, there are no tea kettles in the rooms so you need to go downstairs to get hot water or pay a service charge to have room service deliver hot water. They also do not have irons available so you have to pay to have your clothes pressed if you don't want to look like you just got off an airplane. Bonus - you get to pay an expedite charge if you find this out too late. Location is great if you're going to a conference but not for much else. This is a little nitpicky but the rooms are dark because there are no overhead lights and the ceilings are painted black (great for mood lighting, not for much else). And finally - this hopefully doesn't happen to everyone - the heating and air conditioning was not working so my room was either freezing or a sauna. I ended up moving to a room with a view so that was nice. All in all not the most pleasant experience.",

In the room, the air conditioner is terribly noisy in the bedroom.  for a long time we could not understand whether this smell seems to us or not, therefore, we didn\u2019t immediately turn to the reception office.  This smell from curtains and air conditioning doesn\u2019t work there either.\nAnd most importantly at the reception refused to help.  They sent a cleaning lady to spray the detorant.  video with noisy air conditioning I put separately.  Unfortunately I can not pass the smell on the Internet.",

Pool on 23rd floor was nice but only 8 beds and no seats. Bed in room very small and uncomfortable with unusable pillows. Mattress cover torn and very worn.\nWorst thing about the hotel are the lifts  ,\nIf you are on one of the top floors you seem to spend most of your day waiting for a lift to arrive and then it seems to stop at every floor.",

                "review_text": "We stayed in a standard double room with an ocean view for 3 nights. The hotel has an initial wow factor with the big windows and obviously beautiful view of Barcelona but it isn\u2019t until you have time to view the specifics that you see some disappointing flaws. Firstly, the bathroom is poorly designed, with no fans or windows for ventilation. The shower+bath screen doesn\u2019t cover enough and water ends up all over the floor. Also, the window is right next to the shower and has one curtain covering it, meaning you choose between having the curtain soaked in water or access for anyone to possibly see you in the shower. The bed was king sized, comfortable and nice. There are two pools, both cold, clean and sizeable. The top floor pool is advertised as an infinity pool but this is certainly not the case as it has a platform at the end of it yet the glass is not clean.\n\nOne of my main reasons for booking was the location, it is good, being directly next to a mall with fast food, restaurants, clothing stores, a grocery store etc. however it is advertised as being \u201c50m from the beach\u201d however that is far from true as it is about a 10 minute walk of 800m. The nearest beach is the nudist strip so expect a lot of topless women and also a lot of trash in the water. Nothing to do with the hotel, but worth pointing out if you want to take your kids to a hotel where they\u2019re near a beach, this probably isn\u2019t the best option unless you don\u2019t mind the nudity.\n\nAt the end we were not made aware of the city fee which was almost 8\u20ac for 3 nights until we were checking out. 8\u20ac isn\u2019t much but only being made aware that we\u2019d be charged AFTER spending most of our holiday money on food, souvenirs etc it was not nice to be presented with a hidden fee.\n\nOverall the stay was okay, but almost every negative aspect could\u2019ve been rectified by stating things more clearly or taking just a little extra time designing the bathrooms. I would probably not stay at this hotel again.",
                "owner_answer": "Hello Lachlan,\nMany thanks for this detailed feedback.\nI\u00b4m glad your overall experience was a positive one but I would have liked it was much better.\nConcerning the tourist tax, it is a tax on stays in all Catalunya for all those who stay in tourist establishments (hotels, apartments, pensions, etc). This is not something ikmposed by the hotel.\nWe do hope you will return to Barcelona Princess Hotel in the future, so we can deliver to you a more memorable experience.\nBest regards\nHotel Barcelona Princess",

Lovely pool at the top with fantastic overlook.\nIn these days, when people are so obsessed with keeping fit and working out, why not invest in a proper 'gym' at the hotel. It takes so litte.... A few treadmills, Basic machines for large musclegroups and some free weights. This is important for a lot of guests:)",

Your comments help us to evaluate and improve the experiences of our guests.\nWE are glad to know you had a great stay with us and you appreciated our service and facilities, but\nwe are however disappointed to see our gym did not meet your expectations.  We have a small gym with the necessary machines for a non-professional training but for our clients to keep in shape.\nWe would really like to welcome you back in a very next future\nBest regards\nHotel Barcelona Princess",

We arrived at the hotel two hours before check in but they allowed us they leave our bags with them and offer us to use their facilities if we like.\nThen later we went to our hotel room which was stunning. The beds were spacious and comfortable. The bathroom had great lighting and mirrors. And the balcony had a beautiful view of the sea and was big enough to seat out on.\nWe then used the gym bar which offers a menu and cocktails. The food was gorgeous from pizzas to burgers. They were cooked to perfection (and the burger cooked to how you like). They had a variety of cocktails and the ones I had (such as mango cooler) were amazing. The staff in the gym bar were delightful (Francesca was so welcoming and such a lovely woman). The view from the bar was also nice with a lovely view of the 1st floor pool (which you can drink out on) and the ocean.\nWe opted in for the breakfast buffet when booking the hotel and what a great it was. The buffet was massive with a variety of food from hot to cold to pastries to cereals. With drinks such as coffee, teas, juices all available. And the layout within the room was nice as well. Such a great buffet and was the one thing that made us get out of bed early!\nThere was an IT/chill out area which was handy to use if you need to print out tourist attraction tickets (for free). The 23rd floor pool was also a nice relaxation area which a gorgeous view.\nRoom service was extremely quick, when we needed spare robes and towels it came within minutes.\nThe hotel also has an ATM, bag weigh scales and another bar downstairs. The view from the glass lifts were amazing.\nThe hotel is located in a great area as well. There's a massive shopping centre right next door which is open til 10, and has a supermarket, clothing stores and fast food shops within it which was really handy at times.\nThen at the back of the hotel there's a taxi rank which always had taxis available, and the tourist hop on hop off bus stop. Both once again were super handy.\nThe beach is around 10 min walk from here, and it's a lovely walk.\nWhen we checked the staff called over a taxi and brought our luggage to the taxi.\nAltogether this is extremely good hotel, well worth the money. It was so homely and very well ran. I can't think of a negative what so ever. Four star hotel should soon turn into five stars!",

When you plan a diner with your customer take a taxi !!\n\n- limited comfort in the room , especially after a long day of running around the convention you need that extra comfort which it doesn\u2019t offer .",

But next time you are with us I recommend you to reserve a superior room instead of a standard one as all superiors have balcony or terrace and so you can go outside.\nRegarding the prices, they are the same for the corner bar and the Gym Bar, so if you consumed the same drinks, the total price should be the same.\nAnd the price of the chips is not 16\u20ac. You can check the ticket of your consumption, and if what you say is correct, please send it to us by mail to verify it.\nWe look forward to hearing from you.\nI wish you a great day\nKindest regards\nHotel Barcelona Princess",

I stayed for three nights. The good about this hotel is that they provide a smartphone for our use and we can make local and internatiomal calls for free. The bad - no coffee maker and iron in the room. Of all the hotels that I have stayed at in my life, this is the only hotel that does not provide coffee maker and iron in the room. This is a big turn off for me. Not staying here even at sub $100 rate.",

We have a laundry service available, we pick up your clothes and give them you back during the same day. We also provide an express service if it\u00b4s more suitable for you, both pressing and laundry.\nAll our rooms have a minibar that is free and that our team fill every day. There is no coffee facilities in room, but you can take a coffee, tea, or whatever you prefer in our bar or even order it to your room as we have a 24h room service.\nWe would really like to welcome you back you stay in Barcelona to provide you abetter experience.\nKindest regards\nHotel Barcelona Princess",

Rooms are nicely designed with comfy beds and sea view is great HOWEVER breakfast is average and if you are on a high floor and like to be on time in the mornings then the lifts will NOT make this possible. On average it will take 10 mins just to get up and down at busy times. To make matters worse the key cards randomly  stop working. The gym is also terrible with old and I would even go so far as to say, dangerous. One running machine turned off half way through a jog and the other had a belt which kept slipping! They also don\u2019t provide an iron, which for a business hotel is utter joke. Had to pay almost 40 euros to get 3 shirts and a psi of trousers dry cleaned as they don\u2019t even have a press only option!! I won\u2019t be staying there again.",

So many shops and restaurants!!\nIt is right beside the metro, tram and bus links so it's really easy to travel to and from.\n\nThe hotel has 2 pools.\nOne on the 3rd floor with views of the sea and the natural museum. This also has a terrace where you can get food and drink. Access to the gym and sauna.\nThe next pool is on the 23rd floor with spectacular views all over Barcelona!!!\n\nThe only downside to the hotel that we could fault was \u20ac22.50 for a fry up!!! (Breakfast wasn't included in our rate)Madness! We actually didn't eat at the hotel because of this.\nAlso accessibility to tea or coffee making facilities in the room would be a great addition to the already fantastic rooms. Oh and an iron!

They didn\u2019t know the prices or product that is on the menu in the rooms. Never said sorry about the keys, or anything. Matter of fact they asked what we did to make the key deprogram. The elevators take 10 minutes to get down, even though there are 3 different ports. It is too far from anything other than the beach. Far from restaurants and monuments. The part of the city is very new and underwhelming. The beach is tacky and has no public bathrooms. The only thing that is ok about the hotel is they have an ok breakfast.

We take all comments immensely seriously and use them to review and to ensure we continue to improve the guest experience.\nWe are located in a quite area not downtown, but there is a metro station just 3 minutes walking distance that takes you to the city center in less than half an hour. And once there, you can visit the most emblematic sites of Barcelona.\nWe will contact our maintenance department to check the shower and the room lock  and we will take the appropriated measures. Thanks for letting us know!\nAbout elevators, we will install a lift intelligent system to optimize the client flow. In fact we are in process of doing it\u2026 and we would like to thank you for your patience and understanding during your stay.\nWe would really like to welcome you back again and give us the opportunity to provide the service all our guest are used to\nBest regards\nHotel Barcelona Princes",

The only problem was the shower head was very high and us shorties had to stand on tiptoe to alter the angle.  The views from the 23rd floor are great. It's a shame that it rained on the day that we would have loved to use the pool on the 23rd floor, but you can't have everything. We would definitely use this hotel again the next time we're in Barcelona.",

                "review_text": "Booked Hotel Barcelona Princess for 3 nights. Had a really nice experience in general but got a bit disappointed of the room placement. The view was extraordinary and every day, after a long day walking, getting back to an impeccable room, man... there is nothing better than that. But... our room was the last of the hall, and I imagine we were place next to the laundry room because the noise, specially at night, was really annoying. We were so tired every day that after the second night, the noise was not that intense, but still, for the price we paid I was expecting a quieter room. Service and personnel were great. We even requested uber eats and the delivery to the hotel went perfectly. Luckily location of the hotel is walking distance from the mall, train and bus stations, you are in beautiful Barcelona in less than 20 minutes.",

And if its not possibole to do it quickly and we have rooms available you wll be moved.\nWe hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back when your travels bring you back to Barcelona.\nBest regards\nHotel Barcelona Princess",
